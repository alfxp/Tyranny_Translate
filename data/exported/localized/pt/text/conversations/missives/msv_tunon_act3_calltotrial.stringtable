Return to the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url] at once. This court has received word that both the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] and [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] have perpetrated acts of aggression on my representative. [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] and [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] have forced my hand and now the hour of trial approaches on a swift tailwind. I would have you present your findings before the court immediately. It is critical that we decide which of the Archons - if any - will rule the Tiers.

Return to the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url] at once. This court has received word that acts of aggression have been perpetrated on my representative by members of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' army. This is unacceptable and their attack has now forced my hand. The hour of trial approaches on a swift tailwind. I would have you present your findings before the court immediately. It is critical that we decide which of the Archons - if any - will rule the Tiers.
