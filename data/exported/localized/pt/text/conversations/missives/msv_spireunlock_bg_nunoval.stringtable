My friend, you're aware of the consequence of your actions, are you not? Of late, uncountable rumors drone about and sting the Court like flies biting at corpses. These rumors, of course, are in direct regard to your loyalties thanks to your Beast-headedness. 

And while it has brought endless amusement to me, it must be causing you something of a stiff backache. 

Whether the Adjudicator has sanctioned an official course of action, or means to, I don't yet know. However, I wished to warn you this: some sympathy for you still survives in the Court, and though it cannot be voiced at this time, there are other means with which you may be helped.

For instance... Tales of your claim to these Spires that cut like swords at the sky have become something of a spectacle at the Court. One could then wager you'd care to know of another, yet unclaimed in the [url=glossary:blade grave]Blade Grave[/url], at a little-known breach in the Oldwalls.

Should you go and take it, one day, I would like you to show me the sights from its peak - accompanying a warm drink and a fresh meal, of course.

And for the mercy of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], DON'T let Calio find out I wrote to you, or she'll badger me for weeks. 

Fortune favor you (as it seems presently the Overlord does not),
