How's that battle going? I assume you survived on account of me not being dead - which, of course, is a very good thing. Me being alive, I mean. I suppose it could be good that you're alive, too.

I know [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] is going to insist you track me down, so I'll help you out. Don't worry about me - I found a nice home in [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] and have gathered a nice group of people who don't mind worshipping me. You can let [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] know I'm doing quite well by myself!
