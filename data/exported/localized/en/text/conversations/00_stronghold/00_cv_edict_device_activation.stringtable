      <DefaultText>The orb in the center of the resonator spins with the push of some unseen force. Where the structure once exuded warmth, now it gives off a ferocious heat that singes your face the longer you stare into it. A sound like music swarms in the air around the structure, but it's painful and disharmonious to your ears. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The umbilical between you and the resonator conducts the energy like a white-hot chain. It's feeding you something you hardly understand, and doubt you could contain. The pain is severe, like a ball of hot iron forming in your chest, and you know that it has to be released before it threatens to consume you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Shielding himself from the heat, Lantry has to shout above the discordant music. "The energies of this place are swirling about you alone. Can't you feel it? Can't you... can't you hear that damnable music!" He claws at the back of his head.

"Do you feel anything different? The energy seems focused on you... does it hurt?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, this is shit!" Sirin has to shout over the disharmonious music. "You'd think a Spire would know some better songs, but I guess there's no accounting for taste." 

She refocuses on you with a mixed expression. "You do realize that the energies of this place are all centered on you? I don't know what makes you so special."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You probably know more about what's going on than I do, but..." she plugs her ears to block the discordant music from the Spire, "I hate this! Isn't there anything you can do to stop it?" 

She pauses and cocks her head. "The Spire... it's stuffing you with power. Really force-feeding it in. Don't you feel that?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"By [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' hairy backside!" Eb covers her ears and takes a step back from the structure at the center of the Spire. "That music! It's awful... feels like my teeth are ripping their way out of my mouth. Don't you hear it?" She attempts to sign a rune, only to see her pattern fizzle into steam. 

"And it's your name! Listen real close and it's your name said over and over until it's just one mystic wail."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Kills-in-Shadow snaps and snarls at the air, momentarily pained by the pitch of the Spire's song. She cracks her spine and pops her shoulders, shifting uncomfortably on her bare, calloused feet.

"Do not like Spire's howling. Sounds of slithering Scourges, of many and more Bane - chasing and biting at Beastwoman's heels."

She tilts her face toward the sky, dusky snout sniffing side to side, eyes squeezed shut, and her purpled lips peel back in a satisfied smirk. 

"But can smell - song is making Alpha stronger, yep?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Argh!" Barik tries to block his ears from the discordant music of the Spire, but only succeeds in rattling his head under his helmet. "It feels like Stalwart all over again! That sound... the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Storms..." He turns to you wearing a look of bewilderment. "Don't you hear it?! The power, it's..." His hands drop to his sides. "It's all funneling into..." 

"Fatebinder, the Spire is acting like you're the eye of a great cyclone."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Spire is now fully awake, its long-dormant currents of energy dance to your presence.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Edicts you've encountered crowd into your immediate memory like an invasion force, suppressing all thought or reason. They come unbidden - yet they're insistent on making themselves known to you. 

As incredible and unbelievable as the idea may seem, you know that you could cast an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] if you tried.</DefaultText>
