      <DefaultText>A rain-soaked cadre of [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] warriors cautiously approaches, with Ceveus - now wearing the regalia of the [url=glossary:iron guard]Iron Guard[/url] - at the lead. "Impossible! How is it you've ripped a piece of Stalwart's storms and carried it here?"

Ceveus, now dressed in the regalia of Ashe's [url=glossary:iron guard]Iron Guard[/url], jabs a gauntleted finger in your direction. "I don't know what you are, or what bargain you've made to command these storms, but your life ends here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A gang of rain-soaked [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] trails behind Death Knell, a mixture of awe and confusion resting upon their faces. "What foul trick are you playing such that the weather comes to your aid?"

"I should thank you for separating the wheat from the chaff. The sight of seeing dozens struck dead by lightning - made a good show to startle the dead weights," she points back behind her shoulder, "leaving the bravest with the privilege of tearing off your limbs, one joint at a time."</DefaultText>

She looks behind her, to the hundreds of fleeing Choirmen. "Think I needed all those unwashed idiots? Just means that me and the top gangs get the best pickings. We'll be happy to lay you to rest in this little funeral pyre you've built for yourself."</DefaultText>

"Did you eat [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]'s heart and become the Archon of Stone or something? What manner of-" her words falter as a tremor sets her off-balance, "how is this possible?"

She looks back at the hundreds of Choirmen fleeing in every direction. "I don't need those cowards! Even with a fraction of our strength, we'll surround you and grind you into nothing!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A cadre of [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] warriors lumbers into the courtyard, their movement slow, deliberate, and stilted as they compensate for the tremors that have gripped the valley at your command.

"What pact did you make with the traitor Archon [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] to invoke such power?" Ceveus, now dressed in the regalia of the [url=glossary:iron guard]Iron Guard[/url], steps forward. "No matter, that's a question for the Earthshakers - they'll no doubt enjoy interrogating the crippled, maimed husk you'll soon become."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Nervous glances are exchanged between many of the warriors gathering in the courtyard. Sensing the dip in morale, Death Knell looks back with a scowl. "We have the advantage of numbers, don't be spineless!" Her shouts do nothing to assuage their fears.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Do not liken yourself to the Overlord! Your magic may have startled my weaker troops, but your magic is nothing my own Blood Chanters could not affect. Isn't that right?"

She looks to one of her mages for a nod of approval, but is met instead with a blanched look of fear, mouth agape in terror.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Don't make us laugh, Binder. Even the lowliest [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] recruit has years more training than you." Ceveus points to the back of his group. "Look, even our youngest stands ready to-"

Ceveus looks at the solider he pointed toward - a young Stone Shield nervously shuffling backward, distancing himself from the fight. "Come on, stand your ground! We can best this traitor, just show some spine!" His words do little to steady the warrior, and you see glimpses of hesitation and doubt in the body language of the troops.</DefaultText>

Ceveus turns to his soldiers, looking to see who shares in his laughter. His guffaws fall flat when he sees his warriors shuffle nervously in silence, their weapons trembling.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You live up to your name, Firestarter! I should have slain you back during the siege of the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url]... to think of what I could have prevented had I taken your head long ago."

He coughs, choking back smoke and ash. "I don't know what lore you stole from the Citadel to replicate this trick of the Overlord, but it matters not. I regret not killing you sooner - now it's time I correct that error."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Impossible! I have seen the Blood Chanters call upon fire, but THIS?! The intensity... the heat... how have you channeled the fires of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]?!"

Ceveus glances back, taking stock of the troops that haven't retreated into the smoke. "The faint of heart may fear your mystic fire, but I was there when the [url=glossary:burning library]Burning Library[/url] was set ablaze, and it will take more than a hapless imitation of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' conflagration to scare me!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The [url=glossary:iron guard]Iron Guard[/url] smashes his gauntlets together with rage. "That mission was a setup for failure! Nerat's spies knew the surrender wouldn't happen!" As Ceveus voice becomes a shrill whine, his soldiers begin to shuffle nervously, heads turning back to ascertain the quickest escape route.

"Your severed head will be my contrition to the great general, and the stain on my record will be erased by today's glorious slaughter!" Ceveus roars with energy, but the warriors flanking him fail to echo his fervor, silenced by hesitation and fear.</DefaultText>
