      <DefaultText>The arcane light courses skyward - trailing off toward the horizon in the direction of [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url].

      <DefaultText>The Spire feels like a relay between you and [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url], bridging some transference of energy on an enormous scale. You are the first link of a chain that stretches the length of the realm. As you struggle to understand this sensation, you grow aware of whispers all around you. </DefaultText>

The surge of energy that courses through you, forming a link with [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url], strengthens the very stones beneath your feet. The structural weakness you detected vanishes, replaced by confidence that could keep this tower standing for millennia. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Dawning Spire in Howling Rock gives you the impression of slow, inexorable movement, like a glacier of living stone. Unstoppable force moves at a pace that no eye could follow. The tower's very immobility is a pretense.

      <DefaultText>The Aurora Spire in Gulfglow feels violent and unsettled, like it would claw itself from the earth if it had the strength. The stones, though clean, feel slick with blood. Something of the ritual and turmoil of the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url] has warped this isolated place over the years. 

You feel energy well up from the ground and, with reckless enthusiasm, form a bond with [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url].</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>For an instant, you can see the accumulated hope and fear these whispers represent. It appears like dewdrops settling on a leaf, then trickling into a shared basin. This image is fed to you through your connection - a base metaphor that only hints at the true scope. 

There is power in these Spires, though its source is unfamiliar. Were you to harness it, you suspect that nothing would stand beyond your reach. </DefaultText>

There's a mystic hum and it has little beats when you walk, tiny fluctuations when you talk. Unless my senses are deceiving me, you and the Spires are mystically attuned to each other."

      <DefaultText>The whispers themselves seem to travel down the tether between you and your Spires, conducting heat that feels at times unbearable. They speak of your actions, your choices - everything that led you to this place. Your name is known, your banner recognized, your deeds reported across the Tiers and the Northern Empire alike. </DefaultText>

She tilts her snout in an eastern direction, crimson eyes soft with emotion.</DefaultText>

The untapped power in this Spire is astounding! I must find out how to get some."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Too bad Spire could not save Stone-Archon from falling to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]. Beastwoman thinks Spire would have wanted to."

She scratches a spindly, curved claw along her collarbone as she peers over the lip of the Spire, down at the petrified Archon clutching its base.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Amazing, you can see out east from here - across to the continent. If we had a long-distance peering device, I wonder if we'd see [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' next wave of invaders starting their journey here. It's maybe for the better that I can't confirm this suspicion..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Is it me, or is the magical field of this Spire in motion? Churning? This place seems to come alive to your presence, just like the Mountain Spire did. Only here, instead of a constant, arcane hum, it's more an intermittent scrape and shout. Isn't a steady hum, but an erratic... choir? Waterfall, maybe? All I know for sure is that one of these days, I'm going to write a treatise on the Spires that'll be the envy of... well, the handful of Sages still left."</DefaultText>
