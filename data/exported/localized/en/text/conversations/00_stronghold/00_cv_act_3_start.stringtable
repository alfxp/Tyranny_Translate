      <DefaultText>"I keep hearing about this little Spire you've been calling your own." Nodding with a smirk, Fatebinder Calio peers over the edge of the tower. "Now that you've slaughtered those who would take your lands, I think your claim is as official as it gets."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] knows, rightly so, that enmities new and old will drive the Archons to mutual destruction. The Overlord need only remove the pretense of peace and watch the ensuing violence." Calio shrugs with a smile.

She snorts and grins savagely. 

"Kills-in-Shadow knew Alpha was most powerful human in whole of Tiers-lands." A curved claw taps the side of her snout. "Nose was not wrong." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I know I'm mostly sober, but just so we're clear, you DID just issue an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url], right?" Lantry taps his quill to his tongue, unsure of what next to write.

      <DefaultText>You feel the need to pause and contemplate what has transpired. Through instinct and will alone, you proclaimed an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] - not by reading the words of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], but by drafting them yourself. The air still crackles with the dissipating energy of your incredible spell. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's only natural to have doubted yourself. The Edicts have always been the magic of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] and [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] alone! Anyone claiming to be able to cast an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] would be presumed crazy. And yet, a sane man watching what you just did would see the power of the Overlord in your voice."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Very little is certain, but one thing stands out from the confusion: you are no mere Fatebinder, no legal clerk to be guided by greater powers. No, you are a power unto yourself - something as great as the authorities that led this war, if not greater.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That is true. I don't think [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] decides who has the power to be an Archon, but [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] is certainly selective of who gets the title. My teacher, Occulted Jade, Archon of Tides never bowed to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]. Her power was her own and she claimed the title of Archon because... well, when she was younger, the Overlord was just a distant tale and so wearing the title didn't arouse conflict."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Correct, there's no [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] backing this order," she smiles a toothy grin, "such encouragement hardly seems necessary when the task is its own reward.

"But [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] CAN give and take titles. And titles change how people see you - how they view your authority, or how big a threat they perceive you to be."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>134</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And considering your promotion came along with an order for the Archons to all kill each other, it sure seems like this is part promotion, part test. If the other Archons kill you, [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] needn't worry about whatever you're becoming.

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>136</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Because Ashe and Nerat work together like water and oil and so letting them each rule half the Tiers is an exercise in bad planning? Because there's no land left to conquer after the Tiers and [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] needs fewer generals?"

Calio shrugs with a ruddy-faced smile. "[url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s not here so I don't mind pointing out that [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] isn't exactly a loving ruler, and the Archons are disposable pawns, not beloved subjects. The land has been conquered, why not dispose of the conquerors?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>137</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And I would further speculate that [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] hates all of the Archons equally - and so instead of nominating all but one for destruction, the Overlord is willing to let the strongest earn the right to exist."</DefaultText>
