      <DefaultText>"This is no small thing you've accomplished. People all across the Tiers will discuss it... in secret, of course. [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] is still a threat to this Realm, but for the first time we can imagine rising up."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>From the top of the Spire, you can make out the distant features of [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url] and the mountains beyond. A few vague, twisted lines of purple and red show the retreat of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces. </DefaultText>

And going forward, we have the advantage of a divided enemy! For the moment, the momentum is ours."</DefaultText>

"For everyone's sake, you should report to [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] - if only to keep up appearances."

"Like it or not, your fealty to [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] will shield us from the Archons - so it's best you maintain relationship with the Court as best you can. Otherwise"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She pauses, quietly sizing you up for a quiet moment. "You are right. I suppose I incorrectly assumed your cooperation. Go speak to your Archon.
