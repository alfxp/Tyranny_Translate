      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder... Archon, the Great General has pulled his troops back to Iron Hearth." She grinds her knuckles into her palm. "Soon we make our final push into the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url] and the heart of [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] power! [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]The Voices of Nerat[/url] is weak, and the path to Cacophony is clear." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She adopts a more cautious tone. "The Archon is also aware of what happened at [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url]. I'm sure he wants to discuss the matter in person." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Are you sure about that?" She regards you with skepticism. "You're different, there's no denying that much, but even the Archons are subservient to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]. Try not to forget where you came from." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I wouldn't spend too long considering. You've demonstrated incredible power, and this is a time for action. I'll send Ashe a bird so he knows to expect you later, if not right away." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Beastwoman has been patient, yep-yep. Understands long hunt. Has helped Alpha even though Alpha fights for army of iron-clads. But Kills-in-Shadow cannot wait any longer."

She bristles and rises on her hind legs, purpled lips peeling back from her jagged fangs, her tightly-corded muscles quivering as she towers over you.</DefaultText>

      <ID>14</ID>
      <DefaultText>A harsh growl rips from her throat as she curls her claws in the air, instantly incensed.

"Yep-yep, NOW - Alpha will listen with both ears to Beastwoman. Or will not like what happens next."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She chuffs, more amused than cowed. Her crimson eyes rove your body with an obvious longing, and she licks her sharp-tipped fangs.

"Can snarl and growl at Beastwoman until darkness falls and moon rises, but Alpha will listen to Kills-in-Shadow NOW."

The unspoken 'or else' hangs heavy in the air between you. Whatever her issue is, the Beastwoman's not going to let it go lightly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Am thinking maybe Alpha is not using [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] to hunt [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], but maybe instead - Alpha is loyal to iron-clads? Do not like this thinking. Makes Beastwoman want to kill Alpha."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Bluff] "Keep your voice down. You want the Iron Marshal to hear us? Of course, we're using the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] to hunt [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Beastwoman softens and settles cautiously back down onto her haunches. She huffs heavily, but it seems more relieved than anything as scents the air, her lips parted, her tongue and teeth bared.

"Words smell-taste of truth. Means Alpha would not lie to Beastwoman, yep?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Really? Alpha speaks true?"

She cocks her massive, dusky head to one side and scratches a claw through her blood- and mud-matted mane. 

"Would not lie to Beastwoman? To creature who is cut from darkness and kills with shadows? Would not lie and think could live, nope?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Alpha!" She snarls and slathers, furious beyond words. For a moment, she merely quivers with barely contained violence. 

Then finally, she growls long and low - threatening. "Or maybe will not be Alpha any longer?! Maybe time has come for Beastwoman to slaughter weak, lying leader! Protect self and Beastwomen tribes!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Claws raking the air, she shrieks in anger and surprise. Her eyes are wide - wild - with fear, and though she strikes viciously for your throat, you are swifter, more ruthless, stronger and sharper-edged than the snarling Beastwoman. You gut her without mercy, and spit on her remains for daring to betray you.

Let it be a lesson to others.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She chuffs, but there is little amusement behind it, and when she speaks her words rumble from her in a barely discernable growl.

"Human can stare at Beastwoman's teats until darkness falls and moon rises, but Alpha will listen to Kills-in-Shadow NOW."

The unspoken 'or else' hangs heavy in the air between you. Whatever her issue is, the Beastwoman's not going to let it go lightly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She snorts. "Fine. Kills-in-Shadow believes Alpha. Will be patient for while longer. But do not forget Beastwoman's promise."

As she pads off on all fours, she tosses you one last look over her shoulder, her words gruff as she warns -

"In coming season, Kills-in-Shadow WILL hunt whole of [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] dead."</DefaultText>
