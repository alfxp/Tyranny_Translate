      <DefaultText>He takes a cautious step back. "G-Garus! I'm your scribe and researcher! I've heard great things about you, about this... this place. The library here is incredible, if you don't mind my saying so." He quails back with uncertainty and fear.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, if you want to hold strictly to the truth, you didn't... but I never let details like that stop me in the past! [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] Tacitus always encouraged me to show ambition ahead of restraint, and I am nothing if not a student of good advice." He straightens his posture and clears his throat. "With your permission, of course." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So you just invited yourself into the mix!" Lantry wipes his brow, leaving a sepia streak. "Ah, such foolhardy initiative reminds me of a younger me. It's amazing I still have my teeth considering what a fucking twit I used to be. Oh who am I kidding - still am."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Sages seem to be the new crotch sore... they just keep appearing atop your big hard monument at inopportune moments." Eb gestures her staff toward the edge of the Spire platform. "Of course, I'm happy to show him the exit - we could take wagers on how long it takes for him to fall - closest over or under wins."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"When I heard about the library you were building, I just had to come! I watched the workers as they hauled the stone and scrolls up here. There was an awful lot and they were very tired, so I did what little I could to assist. Then on the last day, as everyone was leaving, I just... stayed behind."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh, any number of topics! Magic, alchemy, the history of the world... You have an impressive collection. Not as large as the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url], perhaps, but no sense in crying over burnt parchment. I've started compiling a list of possible research topics. Allow me to show you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I take it you'll need someone to organize this collection of scrolls, someone to catalog new texts as you discover them, and someone organize research efforts. As your scribe, I can do all three. In fact, I'm excited to get started. I've already started looking through your collection and-" He cuts himself off and sighs. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Forgive me for broaching such an indelicate subject, Fatebinder, but... we are short of funds here. The research I offer is involved, comprehensive and... costly. I'm sure you understand." He manages a nervous smile. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Indeed, and I'm afraid I have you at a disadvantage." He nods. "[url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] Garus, formerly of the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url]. Scribe and researcher extraordinaire... not to bore you with honorifics." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"To be honest, I need the work. The [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url] isn't exactly up to its old standards, and I'm afraid there aren't many safe places where a [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] can find employ during the war."</DefaultText>
