      <DefaultText>On closer inspection, a series of symbols carved around the base of the structure come into view.

One symbol pulses with a blue-white glow. The pattern resembles the glowing lines of light seen on the floor of [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url] moments before you found yourself transported above the clouds.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'd be careful going any closer. This whole tower is humming with energies that we don't understand." Lantry holds his quill poised above a sheet of parchment with anticipation. "Now... I didn't say back away... let's find out what it does! Just be cautious."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I can feel power running through this place..." Eb surveys the surroundings, her gaze sweeping to the object at the center, "you can sense the magic of the Spire even from down below... but up here, this close to the axis of the Spire, the deluge of energy is numbing."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The surface of the stone edifice trembles at your words. For a brief moment, the solid rock undulates, the same motion as a quiet pond rippled by rain. An echo bounces back from afar, your voice distorted and unfamiliar. 

"...is this thing..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The stone is smooth and cool to the touch. Marbling patterns move with the curves of the sculpture, looking more akin to veins than imperfections of rock. You can't find a single marking to suggest an artisan's tool. 

As you are about to draw your finger away, you feel a sudden return pressure on your fingertip as the sculpture touches you back. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The sculpture is once again still.

There is a rush warmth through your body, a jolt of enervation that steadies your balance. A barrage of tactile sensation floods your mind as you FEEL footsteps and wind, but not on your face or your limbs. A moment later, the flood of information begins to make sense - you are feeling the wind against the Spire, and even the weight of your own feet, as if the Spire were a second spine.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The link between you and the Spire recedes. The arcane bond is still present, but the mystical energies, for the moment, are quiet.

Your body flooded with excitement and fatigue, it's unclear whether the mystic connection is strengthening you or siphoning - the tower offers nothing by way of answer, and you know that asking would only yield more silence and mystery.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You see a Spire at the crossing of an ancient, stone structure - two walls extending off into the distance. 

At the base of this eternal spire, settlers and merchants act in every way unconcerned, toiling under the observation of unforgiving taskmasters. As the shadow of the Spire falls over them, the mood changes. The settlers pause in shared unease, and look up at the sky.

Toward you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You see a Spire rising over a blasted land. The trappings of a once-mighty civilization lie in ruins, the land itself contorted under the push of mighty winds. 

A storm of great power tears across the region, filling the air with a strangling cloud of rust and debris.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Inside the ancient spire, shadows stretch longer than they should. The hairs on your body prickle with a rush of awareness. There is power here.

Set in the ground, glowing gems form a strange rune, though it hurts your eyes to trace its lethal edge. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You sense a distant awareness in the colossus - a half-mad, agonized hunger that feels without emotion and knows without knowledge. 

The cowled ones assemble around the corpse and begin to chant words of ritual. As the first arcane syllables ignite the air, the corpse stirs in awakening. Too weak to move, it turns its attention toward you, and you can feel the mountain's eyes peering through your flesh.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With a gentle tug, your focus pulls back to a new horizon, though it takes you a moment to recognize it as [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url].

      <DefaultText>Shadows envelop you, muting all sound and vision with slight delay. There is a feeling of perversion, of wrongness - whatever arcane power is allowing your senses to drift free of your body seems to falter in this place. 

Figures haunt the stone halls - drifting emanations of cloud, claw, and fang. They pay you no heed, but you fear them all the same. 

In the depths of this forbidden place, the deepest chamber is bathed in light. An arcane symbol illuminates the floor, though the details hurt your eyes when you focus.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The opening feels like a wound, an infected abscess - a wrongness that cannot be righted. As you look deeper, your skin prickles with a feeling of phantom violation. 

Figures of smoke, shadow and claw pace the cavernous Oldwalls with tireless hunger. This fiction of your presence is an annoyance to them - nothing more.</DefaultText>

      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>You look farther still. A massive humanoid form clings to the edge of a bottomless crevasse - its body and limbs gargantuan in stature, but its proportions that of a spry man. Dying, but still possessed of some life, he cries in a mixture of pain and relief, crystal shards roll down from his eyes.

Cowled figures attend to him with reverence. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your hand touches the sculpture, and you are greeted with a familiar jolt. Where in the past, the Spire would throw your senses outward, this time, your perceptions shrink, deafen, and contort. The horizon falls away, and your body grows numb to the wind's touch.

All that exists is where you hand meets the stone.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The sculpture and the Spire it rests atop cease to feel as solid stone.

      <DefaultText>Sizzling heat races down your arm, and your feet feel for the moment to be hovering just above the stone floor of the Spire. The sensation is oddly familiar - hearkening back to the moment you broke [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Execution.

As this old pain ripples through your body, the waves of pain extend beyond the length, width, and breadth of your form, until the sensation is running down the Spire, its masonry an extension of your spine.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Focusing on a particular point of view, your senses settle into a field far away, into a body looking at the Mountain Spire in awe. As he peers at the Spire, you can tell he knows the stone edifice is yours - and his fear and concern toward you feel palpable and invigorating - as if the more he fears you, the more limitless you become.</DefaultText>

      <ID>88</ID>
      <DefaultText>With a calming exhale, you focus on the flood of sensation, sipping the visions so as not to drown.

Common to all the visions are the shared experience of looking upon the Spire. The concern, focus, fear, and curiosity of these onlookers stirs the arcane energies of the great monument, and the greater the passion behind these thoughts, the more the Spire crackles with potential.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you imagine the sense of heaviness, your perceptions drift toward the ground, hurtling through the soil until your vision resumes in the dark, foreboding halls of the Oldwalls.

Though you can make out almost nothing in the cramped darkness of the Oldwalls, you can feel the Oldwalls running through the soil of Terratus, linking many of the Spires with these mystical arteries.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you near the mystic currents, you hear inchoate voices - commands, proclamations - the stuff of Edicts.

All across Terratus, the Edicts of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], some centuries old, still live on, their arcane signatures bright as the midday sun - seemingly stronger than the day they were proclaimed.</DefaultText>

      <ID>98</ID>
      <DefaultText>While the Spire is quick to flood you with sensation, the link does not feel symmetric, as you get a sense the Spire seems largely blind to your eyes, indifferent to your pain, yet eminently listening to you, eagerly awaiting the sound of your voice so that it might yell your words from upon high for all Terratus to hear.</DefaultText>

      <ID>99</ID>
      <DefaultText>You run your hand along the sculpture and bask in the mystic warmth. There is magic in the Spire, and as master of the Spire, it's your magic - a power that grows each day as the masses love and fear you - each thought or emotion a drop until the whispering of your names becomes a current of power.

The vicious cycle of magic seems crystal clear - your greatness powers your deeds, your deeds foment fear, fear powers your greatness, and the cycle begins again.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>100</ID>
      <DefaultText>You can't help but chuckle at the vicious cycle - they see the Spire so they fear and adore you, but that fear and adoration makes you stronger, making them fear and adore you more, which in turns makes you stronger.

For all your lessons in magic, this principle of channeling fear, harnessing thought was never touched talked about or even theorized. Perhaps it is the sort of thing only [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] is meant to know.</DefaultText>
