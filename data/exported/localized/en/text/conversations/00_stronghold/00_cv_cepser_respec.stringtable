      <DefaultText>"The foul-mouthed Chorus girl? I didn't realize she had training to break." He sighs, takes a deep swig of wine, and nods. "We shall see what can be done with her."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I can certainly try." He scowls. "Perhaps I'll start by breaking his insistence that Tiers wine is superior to that of the Empire..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"[Player Title] [Player Name], a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance." His bow strikes you as perfunctory at best. "I am Fatebinder Cesper. I understand that you reached out to the court for a trainer. I have been provided. I've also brought wine." He lifts a clay flagon in salute.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Think of what I do as teaching an old hand new tricks. I break pupils of the unwanted habits they've picked up so that they may form new ones. Break being the operative word." He smirks and takes a swig of wine. "Unlearning can be far more difficult than learning."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I fear that that story is far longer than either of us have time for." He chuckles mirthlessly. "Suffice it to say that I have served as a member of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s Court longer than most other Fatebinders and have earned something of a dotage as a result. Apparently that now involves assisting in the [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]-forsaken Tiers." He looks back towards the horizon. "Though this, I admit freely, is the absolute rarest of views."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Before you stands a wizened man in the courtly garb of a Fatebinder. He seems to be lost in thoughtful examination, his gaze scrutinizing the details of the Spire. He shifts his attention to you after a moment, offering a wan smile.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The north's finest, a large cart's worth of casks. Required a team of six Beasts to haul it, and worth every damned iron ring if it saves me from the southern swill." He raises the flagon to his lips.</DefaultText>
