      <DefaultText>The [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url]'s bottom lip bunches into a scowl. "Fatebinder [Player Name], what a twisted series of events to find myself in such unique destitution that the only means of survival depends upon granting services to you - [url=lore:bl_lava_level]the one who created the circumstance of my squalor[/url]."

She gives a deep and solemn sigh. "But if one is to continue learning, one must survive." She straightens her posture. "If knowledge of magic or lore is what you seek, only ask."

      <DefaultText>The [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] immediately takes hold of your hands, shaking them profusely. "Fatebinder [Player Name]! What a curious set of circumstances! You may not remember me, but I was there - [url=lore:bl_lava_level]Among the countless mages who were able to flee before Kyros' Edict reduced the Vellum Citadel to the burning husk it is today[/url]."

She regains her composure. "Apologies for my exuberance. It will be my distinct honor in training you in the magical arts of life, or the depths of lore."</DefaultText>
