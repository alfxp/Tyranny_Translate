      <DefaultText>She catches your eye with a stare that casts a shiver down your spine. "Fatebinder [Player Name], I have been given permission by [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] to train you in the arts of manipulating emotion, as well as granting vigor on the battlefield."

There is room for improvement, no doubt."</DefaultText>
