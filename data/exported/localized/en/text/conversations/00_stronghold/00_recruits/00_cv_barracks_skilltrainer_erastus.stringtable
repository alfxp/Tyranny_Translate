      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder." He nods and regards you warily. "When I came to your aid, I had thought you kept the best interests of the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] at heart... but my judgment has been impaired before. Shall we go over a lesson?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Earthshaker squints to make you out. "Ah, Fatebinder! You couldn't have picked a better Spire to claim. I'm sure you're just brimming with questions."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I have ways. During the war, [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] imparted unto me the secret lessons of stone, and when properly harnessed..."

He sighs and lets his shoulders slump. "I followed you up, and I've been hiding until I could find an opportune time to introduce myself." He glances around the Spire. "Hiding is difficult." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The fact that we stand upon one of the great and ancient mysteries of the world, sharing this pleasant conversation, means that you are a person of influence and power, and I want to make sure that your talents are harnessed appropriately. Shall we begin?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Strictly speaking... yes. But there was some confusion during a battle in the Azure campaign, and I was not accounted for during the return muster. Until further notice, I have officially died on the field of battle. Isn't it exciting?!" He wrings his hands with joy.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm more interested in helping you bring this awful war to a close, and I doubt even the Overlord would object to a victimless lie. Chalk it up to the [url=lore:magician_folly]Magician's Folly,[/url] if you must. My talents are for the glory of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], and I can do no wrong."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, I'm a rather accomplished mage - have I mentioned that? - and I thought to myself: 'You've been hurling rocks this entire war. Why not find someone of influence and offer them your guidance.' Thinking it a better use of my time, I slowly made my way up here." He smiles.</DefaultText>
