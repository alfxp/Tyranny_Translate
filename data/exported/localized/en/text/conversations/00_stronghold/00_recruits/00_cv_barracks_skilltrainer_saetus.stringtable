      <DefaultText>A thin, sinewy man looks out to the horizon, legs firmly planted on the ground as he practices his strikes. His arms snap towards an invisible target in methodical fashion, alternating one after the other. He stops as you approach, an amused smirk on his face.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And that, Fatebinder, is exactly what I'd advise you not to do." He laughs, punching the air again while adopting a cretinous expression. "That may work when you've got a hundred Stone Shields at your back, but someone like you thrives with a little more creativity."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"On the contrary, I've all the respect in the Tiers for them... they just don't happen to care for it." He points towards the northern horizon. "They're not fond of bastards, even if your mother happened to serve in the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>“I can teach you all about making that fine paste. It may not grace the pages of a [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url]’s chronicle, but it’ll make you laugh at night when you’re counting your rings and downing your ale.”</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My boyhood dreams were of joining the legion and being cloaked in purple and iron, but now I spend my days dancing around fools that think a breastplate makes them a better fighter." He nods, satisfaction evident in his tone. "I wouldn’t have it any other way."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He stiffens up in mock formality, offering you the slightest of bows. “That’s where I come in, or so your generous sum of rings has led me to believe.”</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I prefer to dance around my foes, tripping them with the weight of their own armor or stabbing them with their own blades. Even better - winning the fight before it starts! Walk around in my rags and seasoned warriors will hardly give you a second glance. Their years of training won’t amount to much when their sword arm suddenly breaks, or when their balls have been compressed into fine paste.”</DefaultText>
