      <DefaultText>The man's face lights up the moment you approach. "Ah, Governor [Player Name], is it alright if I refer to you by your old form of address? We have yet to have someone run [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] as well as you did - so far as I'm concerned, the mantle will always be yours." He fidgets with his hammer anxiously for a moment before lowering his voice. "If I may be so bold, I have a question for you..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The man bows deeply before you. "Esteemed Fatebinder [Player Name], with so many hours spent in the forge, we artisans are a bit prone to gossip. Needless to say, the Fatebinder of the Mountain Spire has been the subject of many a conversation while working the bellows." He fidgets with his hammer anxiously for a moment before lowering his voice. "If I may be so bold, I have a question for you..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Praxis bows his head, crestfallen. "Yes, there are more important matters at hand than these silly questions."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Praxis' eyes light up with the same intensity of the forge behind him. "From where does [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' power truly stem? Is it from the magic of Edicts? Is it from Archons, or perhaps from the loyal subjects and their toil?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Archons are the true source of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' power. With such mighty creatures at the overlord's disposal, she can delegate much of her affairs, and her reach becomes limitless."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'd argue the commoners of the world are the source of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' power. It is their collective submission that legitimizes [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' rule."</DefaultText>

      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Edicts are the crux of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' power. Powerful magic that can shape the very landscape gives [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] dominion over our reality."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Praxis quietly nods to himself for a moment almost forgetting you were ever there. "Ah, my apologies for indulging myself in the philosophical. Is there anything I can do for you?"</DefaultText>
