      <DefaultText>"I..." She rubs her arm and shivers, looking around the Spire. "I don't remember coming here. Last thing I recall was laying down on my bedroll in Iron Hearth. Before I could blow out my candle, a shadow appeared and snuffed it out."

"Then I just... woke up here. How do I get back down to join the legion?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She blinks. "No! That can't be true - not while you come and go as you please! There's always a way out..."

She glances at the edge of the Spire and bites her lip. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She balls her fist and hits it to her side. "No! I fought too hard to let some mindless tower defeat me now! If I'm here, I... might as well make the best of it."

She looks at you with new resolve in her eyes. "Just because I'm scared doesn't make me blind. You're the Fatebinder who broke the siege at [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url], aren't you? If you're still keen on making yourself useful, I can help. I know weapons better than anyone in my cohort."</DefaultText>
