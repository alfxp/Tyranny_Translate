      <DefaultText>"Old Stalwart was ruled by tradition and an ofttimes twisted sense of national identity. The stories they held in high esteem set most of the precedent."

"Thankfully for Queen Hadrium, the story was convincing enough that people bought into the new tradition. Lucanun later died to a wasting disease, but that's a story for another day." She chuckles.</DefaultText>
