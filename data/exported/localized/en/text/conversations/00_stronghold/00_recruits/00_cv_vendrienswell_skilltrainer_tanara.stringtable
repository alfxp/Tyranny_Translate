      <DefaultText>Her voice is measured and confident. “Thank you for allowing this humble warrior atop your Spire. I spent countless years in Apex’s valleys looking upward, and now here I stand, above the clouds. It will be an honor to help you capture the Tiers.”</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her expression is neutral, and her tone one of forced cordiality. “I am ready to serve, as requested. Though the Apex of old is no more, I am ready to help you find its new place in the Tiers.”</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You see a bronze-clad woman in meticulously-maintained attire - the leather buckles in her chestpiece show fresh oil, and the scales on her armor have been neatly arranged. She gives a quick bow as you approach. “Fatebinder.”</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>“Yes, proudly. There is no greater duty than to serve your country. Apex’s challenges are many, and they are rarely addressed abroad. This valley has been assaulted time and time again. What would have remained, had we abstained from vigilance?”</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>“Instilling resolve, first of all. We all need purpose for the fights ahead, and unless you know why you bleed on the battlefield, it will be all too easy to succumb to fear and pain. And discipline, most of all. The Guard received hotheaded recruits all the time, and they would all be dead if they charged every time their blood boiled.”</DefaultText>
