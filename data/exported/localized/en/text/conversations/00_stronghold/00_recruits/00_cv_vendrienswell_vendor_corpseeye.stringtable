      <DefaultText>"Unusual? Yeah." His eyes, cloudy and scarred, bob unfocused in their sockets, and he grins at you, revealing several cracked or missing teeth. "Fitting? You tell me."

You can't shake the eerie sense that despite appearances, Corpse Eye is in fact able to see. After all, didn't you recently witness him fighting on the battlefield? Regardless, he doesn't seem to find his condition at all distressing. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] member's blind eyes roll left and then right. He bobs his head to one side, whole body tremoring lightly. Finally, the silence stretches too long and Corpse Eye breaks under the weight of your scrutiny. "All right, yeah, fine! Maybe I deserved it and maybe I didn't. Regardless, I ain't daft enough to try it against you, boss."</DefaultText>
