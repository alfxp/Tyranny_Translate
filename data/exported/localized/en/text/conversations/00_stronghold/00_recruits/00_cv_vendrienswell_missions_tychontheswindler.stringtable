      <DefaultText>"Master Fatebinder." A cloaked man tips his head to you, face hidden beneath a thick, dark cowl. When he looks back at you, lifting his face from the shadows, you notice a wry smile on his twisted and scarred lips.

      <DefaultText>"I had hoped you'd find additional need for my services, and yet years passed with not a word. Regardless, it is good to see you again, my friend."

The thief glances sidelong, eyes sweeping a subtle appraisal of the room. He taps a slender finger to one cloaked ear and continues in a quieter tone. "[url=lore:BCity_Tychon]My deeds[/url] may have been forgotten, but my station has considerably improved. And you have fared more than well. The world whispers your name in every shadow.

      <DefaultText>"Not nearly as interesting, comfortable, nor clean." The swindler plucks a bronze dagger from a sheath on his thigh. He flicks the blade slowly back and forth, blade glinting in the low candlelight as he digs dirt from beneath his fingernails. 

"I was Bastard born and raised. Had never so much as dipped a toe out of the city before my mother died and my aunt promptly kicked me out on my keel."</DefaultText>

Tychon rubs a finger over his blade-scarred lips, smiling fondly at the memory. "After, I spent a time training Fifth Eye's men in the ways and means of my trade.
