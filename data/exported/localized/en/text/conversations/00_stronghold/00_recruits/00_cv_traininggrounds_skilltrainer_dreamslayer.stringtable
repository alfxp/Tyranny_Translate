      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder! I like your tower." The [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] fighter nods and takes an appreciative survey of his surroundings. "Dream Slayer at your service." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She puts up her hands in humored defense. "First and foremost, I'm a friend - so retract your claws, or whatever [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] gives his students to shape them into killers." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Heh... Clever Fatebinder. As it happens, I'm between gangs right now, so I've been making my way from one point of the map to the next and picking fights wherever I go." She shrugs. "As good a way to pass the time as any, right?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <DefaultText>She counts off her fingers. "I've fought the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url], I punched a [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] in his stupid face, and I even grappled with a Beastman. If the opportunity ever rises again, I would decline that last one." 

"But I haven't fought a Fatebinder yet, and I'm willing to bet we can learn a thing or two from each other. I promise I won't take up too much space. I'll even shit off the edge so I don't make a mess - you won't find a better bargain than that!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Because you don't know anyone unless you've lowered them to the level of a Beast - and you don't know yourself, for that matter. I don't have a mind for numbers or letters, but I like to think that I have a halfway decent handle on myself."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"In my previous gang, I was in charge of breaking in new recruits - surprise beatings, taunting, shame..." She draws her arm across her nose and sniffs. "You know. This and that. Whatever dreams people had before the war swept them up, I made sure they got what was coming." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I... uh, followed you." She coughs into her fist. 

"War is a time of opportunity - mostly to live or die. It's rare enough that any of us stick around long enough to make a difference. So when I saw you make it to the top of this place, I recognized my chance. I snuck through that portal thing an instant before it closed. I'm lucky I didn't lose any limbs for the effort, let me tell you." </DefaultText>
