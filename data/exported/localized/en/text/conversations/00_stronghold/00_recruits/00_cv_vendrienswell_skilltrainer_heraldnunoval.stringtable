      <DefaultText>"Ah, [Player Name]. You return, unscathed and more acclaimed than ever - as seems to be your way." The Fatebinder of War claps you good-naturedly and with excessive strength on the back.

"Come. You must regale me with all that your journey has held. I could use a moment of respite between friends." 

He regards you with a warm, boisterous smile.</DefaultText>

"Those killing winds of dust, grit, and sword will rage across fallen Stalwart until the ruling Regents are broken. They call the realm '[url=glossary:blade grave]Blade Grave[/url]' these days.

He laughs hard and hearty. "It was nothing so exciting as you're no doubt imagining. I was merely burning corpses that awaited burial. Before the local authority could see me to the gallows, the Adjudicator claimed me a great talent waiting to be realized, needing only to be steered."</DefaultText>

The hardened warrior's stance is stiff but ready. His hand rests on the iron hilt of his halberd, but he does not lift the weapon from its holster. 

"Is there nowhere you will not traipse, creature of darkness?" he demands. "Is there is no hovel in any Realm that you Beasts fear?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She bobs, momentarily excited, before settling down. Her rough, mauve tongue dangles, dripping saliva between her fangs as she chortles and yips deeply.
