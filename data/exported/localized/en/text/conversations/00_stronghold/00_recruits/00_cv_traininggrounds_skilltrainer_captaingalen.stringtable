      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder." The well-built Southerner snaps to a quick salute. "It's... well, fascinating to stand before you, really. This place makes the walls of the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url] look like toys." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You may not remember me, but I was the Guard Captain who helped get [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces better acquainted with the City before they took it out from under us." His smile has pride and doubt in equal parts. "Saved a few lives in the process, so I guess that makes me a traitor and a patriot." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't believe we've been acquainted. Captain Galen, formerly of the City Guard." He raises his hand to offer it, but thinks better of the gesture and returns it to his side. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, hopefully I'm making a difference. It's tough to feel involved from the top of a Spire, but I have too many seasons under my belt to join the front lines."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's been a few years since [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] dispatched my soldiers - most of them to the Chorus - so I'm looking for ways to stay useful."

He glances over the edge of the Spire and suppresses a shiver. "You'd think my fear of heights would have resolved itself by now." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm here to train you, plain and simple... assuming you're interested. Before the forces of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] marched south, I had twenty years of whipping new recruits into shape and keeping the old ones battle ready, so I know a thing or two about weapons and combat." 

"Interested in facing off and seeing what's left to learn?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He frowns and rubs the back of his head. "Funny you should ask. After I heard about what happened in [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url], I decided to track you down and offer my help. No sooner had I set out then I took a hard blow to the head."

"Then I just... woke up here. Strange how these things work out, isn't it?" </DefaultText>
