      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder! Come take a look!" The dirt-caked Apex local gestures to an old box at his feet. "I've got a Beastman cub in here!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You step up to the huckster and peer down into the box. It's full of assorted junk, nothing more. 

Before you can comment, you notice him reaching for your ring belt out of the corner of your eye.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He makes a high-pitched squeal that echoes over the expanse of the valley. 

"I didn't mean anything by it! I promise! I just wanted to see how many rings you had so I... so I could adjust my prices accordingly."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That was very dishonest of you. I'll take a look at your wares, but don't try that again."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He flinches and withdraws his hand with a hurt look. "Sorry about that, Fatebinder... old habits, you know." 

"I was only curious how much you were carrying. A merchant needs to be aware of these things before he can charge an appropriate cost, eh?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ahh, you're not falling for that old pearl, are you?" He waves you off and loses some of his easygoing demeanor. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Revos at your service. I've come into possession of some items that might be of interest." He waggles his eyebrows.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>At first he seems about ready to spout off a hasty answer, but he pauses and reconsiders. 

"Mm, no. No in the sense that they aren't stolen, but yes in the sense that I'm not entirely..." he coughs into his fist, [url=lore:kyros_quota]"licensed."[/url]</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But wait wait wait!" He puts his hands up. "Before you throw me into [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s dungeon or worse, consider this..." He spreads his arms and turns in a circle. 

"We aren't standing on Terratus. We're standing high above any citizen who is subject to the Overlord's law, and this place couldn't possibly be subject to the same rules that govern down there!" He stamps his foot and points to the land below.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Don't presume to understand [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' will. I need to consider the legalities. In the meantime, I'll take a look at your goods."</DefaultText>
