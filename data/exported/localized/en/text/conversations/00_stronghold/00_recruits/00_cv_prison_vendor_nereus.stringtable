      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder, come closer! I have something for you." The thin stranger offers a toothy smile, and beckons with a hand curled into a fist.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There we are. This should only take a moment." 

Before you can react, he opens his palm to reveal a handful of black powder, which he blows into your face with the full force of his breath.

It's too late to do anything about it. You bat at the cloud to disperse it, but you've already inhaled no small amount of the substance.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He nonchalantly slaps his hands together to clean them off. "Nothing to worry about - those were ordinary ashes. What do you think would have happened if I was a dishonest man, hmm? You would be sucking the air for breath as your skin turned the color of rotten eggplant." He shakes his head at the thought.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Wars can be fought with more than just blunt objects. Growing comfortable with poisons can be as unnerving as spooning a Scourge, but in truth these seemingly innocuous powders and potions can be your most enthusiastic friend on the battlefield." He grins and opens a deep satchel.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That was a test, and you passed marvelously! Never approach a stranger who doesn't open his palm in a gesture of welcome." He nods at you with pride. "The first lesson in dealing with poisons and we who adore them."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I am indeed, and it could have been THAT easy to strike down [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s most accomplished Fatebinder!" He snaps his fingers.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He puts up a defensive hand. "Let's not be hasty here. I think we both know that [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] would thank me for the instructive lesson, would he not? I'm sure that he had his own teachings about countering assassination."</DefaultText>
