      <DefaultText>"Hello, Fatebinder. A fine day for some experiments, wouldn't you say?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She turns to give you her full attention, her smile broad and energetic. “Fatebinder! I may be here to offer my knowledge, but I shall forever be a student. Unfortunate results, but truly fascinating, wouldn’t you agree? I hope you won’t mind the occasional experiments. Of course, I’m here to provide you with whatever arcane knowledge you seek.”</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She turns to give you her full attention, apologetic in tone. “Forgive me, Fatebinder! I don’t mean to make a mess of this place. I’ll admit, my curiosity is a little hard to control sometimes, but I promise not to waste your time or make too much of a mess up here. I know you haven’t had much love for my fellow Sages, but I’ll try my best to change that. Whatever arcane knowledge you seek, I will provide.”</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Electricity dances across the [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url]'s fingertips. She looks mesmerized by its motion, but quickly extinguishes it as you approach. “Yes, Fatebinder? What can I do for you?”</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The sage before you is distracted, half-muttering to herself while clutching the half-burnt remains of a scroll. Her hands are in motion, tracing the curves of some unknown rune. You suddenly hear the high-pitched cry of a carrier raven as it plummets to the ground, its feathers completely burnt away.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She looks up from the noise and notices you. "Well, that wasn't quite what I was expecting. But I suppose that's the risk with a scrap of the original text." She uncorks a vial and splashes its contents on the bird, which remains completely still on the ground. "Hmm, I suppose it would have to be alive for that to work. Another lesson learned."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>“Must I restrict myself? Think about how much magic would go undiscovered if we had to limit ourselves. But I must confess a certain affinity for electricity applied to a wide variety of objects. Even if the results don’t surprise, they always satisfy.”</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>“More impressive than I imagined, so many times before, from the ground. It is a bit breezy, though. That’s a pain when your profession demands the obsessive collecting of scrolls that are all too happy to scatter to the winds.”</DefaultText>
