      <DefaultText>Gela salutes you. "[url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] has given me permission to provide services to your Spire. My contacts to the North provide me with a wide variety of potions." She looks around to other workers throughout the Apothecary. "Far more effective than these southern grown herbs."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her mouth forms a wide smile. "Yes, proud to say."

      <DefaultText>Gela begins to snap into the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] salute, but then seems to think better of it, bowing. "A pleasure, Fatebinder. My contacts to the North provide me numerous alchemical tonics and poultices, each far more effective than the products of southern herbs." She frowns slightly. "I worked with the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url], previously, but so long as you work to end this war, I'm happy to serve you."</DefaultText>
