      <DefaultText>"Hey, boss. I mean Fatebinder. Fatebinder-boss." Noxia rolls her shoulder and regards you with a tilt of her chin. "Need some training, or just the pleasure of my company?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yeah, I see you there. Need something, or do you just like to stare?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Glory to [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url]! Quite the impressive tower you have here, Fatebinder. It would be a shame if someone... pushed you off the edge!"

The Blood Chanter grips you by your shoulders and tries to wrestle you to the edge.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her head snaps back as she takes the strike. Dazed, she shakes her head to recover, and licks some of the blood dribbling from her nose.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>She hits the stone floor hard and cracks the back of her head. Staring up at the sky with no evident consciousness, you assume she's dead until she blinks and looks at you. </DefaultText>

      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her eyes snap open wide as she makes a painful, choking sound. It takes some time before she fully recovers, taking labored breaths as she attempts to speak.</DefaultText>

      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ow. I wish I could say that I've made worse decisions, but this was a bad one... Bad Noxia!" She pinches her arm and squeezes her eyes shut, enduring and relishing the pain in equal measure.</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>She licks her blood-stained lips and smiles. "That's the Chorus way, Fatebinder. If someone isn't trying to kill you and take your place, chances are you're doing something wrong."

"Thought I could nab myself a free tower. Lesson learned." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I picked up a couple of siege hooks and scaled the edge." She shrugs. "I don't mind saying my arms are fucking tired, which is probably why I didn't put up much of a fight. More's the pity." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Sorry for the whole 'killing you' thing. If I can't take your tower, I'd prefer a place in your gang. It beats getting kicked over the edge, anyway."

"Let me live and I'll teach you what I know. The Voices wouldn't object if I took some time away from my usual gang, so... what do you say?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <DefaultText>"Teach me, then. Try and play nice this time."</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>You manage to twist her arm at an unnatural angle. She grins at the sound of snapped bones, and then headbutts you to break away from the fight. Dazed, she shakes her head to refocus, cradling her arm in her other hand.</DefaultText>
