      <DefaultText>"Archon, Fatebinder!" The Fifth Eye dispels his words like a cloud of gnats. "Whatever you call yourself. Our agents have infiltrated the outskirts of Iron Hearth. Ashe and his troops are as exposed as a raw nerve!"

"Before you make your final assault, [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] wants to discuss that stunt you pulled, yes? People are beginning to talk, and the Archon doesn't want there to be any... misunderstandings." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Trembling with laughter, the Fifth Eye points at you. "Delightful Archon, he knows already! I will keep tempers as a controlled burn here at [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url]. Please send the Archon my regards." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You're to meet the Archon at Cacophony before we hurl our forces at Iron Hearth. I know your warlike ways compel you to do otherwise, but we really must insist." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And Fatebinder..." His piercing, reedy tone subsides, for a moment sounding almost normal. "Remember who you're going to meet. The Archon of Secrets loves nothing more than a challenge, but he also loves to win." He tilts his head to the side in confusion, and then shrugs in a casual manner. The Fifth Eye waves you off with an enthusiastic flap of his fingers. </DefaultText>
