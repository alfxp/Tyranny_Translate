      <DefaultText>You blink away the last of the luminescent trails in your field of vision, the masonry of [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url] is replaced with wide open space in every direction, save for the slab of ancient stone beneath your feet.

High winds shove you, pushing you off-balance. The air is cool and thin - unsatisfying to your lungs.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Every way you look, mountains rise up along a distant horizon. The rivers and forest below bring to mind maps of [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url], and you quickly trace the Matani, the Irenev, and all the numerous waterways of the region.

Higher than you imagined it, this is indeed the pinnacle of the Spire at [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url].</DefaultText>

Lantry's eyes look down over the ledge. Dumbstruck by the vertical plunge, Lantry backs away from the edge. "I may need to retch."</DefaultText>
