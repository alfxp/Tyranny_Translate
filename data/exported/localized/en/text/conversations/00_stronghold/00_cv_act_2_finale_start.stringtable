      <DefaultText>Thrown off balance by the trembling Spire, Arri crouches to regain her footing. "That wasn't an attack, that was the Spire, right? Because if that WAS an attack..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Crouching to the ground to steady herself, Erenyos stays low to the ground until the trembling subsides. "Feels like something is shaking the Spire. The Chorus can't pull off that sort of magic... what in [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] name is going on?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What was that?" The Fatebinder of War crouches low, steadying himself against the vertigo of a too-long glance over the edge. "An assault against the Spire's foundation? Earthshaker magic, perchance? No... it couldn't be..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder, now's as good a time as any to see if your link with this Spire can yield us some measure of defense. At the very least, perhaps you could make sure no one is able to teleport up here. If you can control that, we can at least ensure ourselves a fallback position."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't suppose this magical Spire of yours has some warding magic, or something of that ilk?" She points down toward the Chorus troops amassing below. "Unshakable courage and superior training will only take us so far against that large a force."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Then listen with all your ears can muster, Fatebinder. For I certainly hope you and this stone monolith have some surprise tucked up your sleeve." He points to the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] army below. "Preferably a very big surprise."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I have heard Rhogalus prattle on a great deal about this Spire that thrusts as a blade into the sky, and as well to your mastery of its magic. Before the enemy comes to claim what is ours, I suggest you explore whatever link you have to this tower. Let us hope to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] there's some ward that can be enacted." He shrugs. "Else we'll have no defense but to hurl loose stones from Spire's ledge."</DefaultText>

"Do it. Shout and yell and pretend you're [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]. And when we're done, we'll discuss a real plan."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"THAT is your plan? You think playing pretend Overlord will save you?" He waves his hand at you dismissively. "By all means, shout your words to the winds. I'd wager every ring I have that it can't be done!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I believe you're the only Fatebinder living to have proclaimed an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] twice." He leans in, his expression turning sour. "And I worry it's gone to your head, my friend. Only [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] can work the magic of an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]."

"Of course," Nunoval relaxes, letting out a heavy sigh, "you have nothing to lose but your breath. And if our Overlord is watching, perhaps your proclamation will be answered."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That actually worked?" Arri leaps in the air, pumping her arm in excitement, only for her face to turn pale a moment later. "That actually worked!"

He regards you with a cautious glare. "I knew you held a greatness within you, my friend, but how could I have imagined you'd possess such a breed of magic?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder [Player Name]. You've made new friends, I see." Nunoval gestures lazily toward the panorama of the valley below, at the siege camps dotting the perimeter of your citadel.

"I am here at [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url]'s behest. Should you fall, I will be in possession of the Spire ahead of our enemies. And though I was not instructed to aid you, he didn't specifically forbid me from cleaving a few skulls, should I feel so inclined." He grins, both boisterous and eager.</DefaultText>
