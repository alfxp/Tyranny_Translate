      <DefaultText>"Our foe is in retreat. Their vanguard is broken, the rest of their forces are too afraid of this glorious funeral pyre we've created." He jabs his spear into the corpse of a nearby [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]. "Such a shame, I was starting to almost enjoy the smell of cooked [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We've broken their will to fight - though I think the bolts of lightning and hurricane winds of your storm deserve most of the credit."

So much for [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] courage, your [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Stone has them terrified!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We have the courtyard under our control - leave the clean-up duty to me and my gang. Make haste the top of the Spire - no doubt you'll want a bird's eye view of the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] turning tail and running in shame."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Chorus is in full retreat! Your [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Fire has caused a rout! I almost have to applaud the Choirmen that had the guts to give us a proper fight. I almost wish there were a few more... my sword arm was just getting warmed up."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We've broken them! The tremors of your [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Stone have sent ripples of terror through the Chorus, triggering a rout! The only Choirmen with the nerve to fight us tried their best," she slams her blade into the twitching body of a nearby Choirman, "but their best is irrelevant."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I thought we would blunt our last weapon cracking Chorus skulls before being overwhelmed, but the rabble was downright terrified by your [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url], and panic has claimed the giant mob. I almost feel sorry for the Chorus warriors who were brave enough to stand their ground and fight us. Almost."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The enemy is in retreat, terrified by your [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]. The few warriors brave enough to stand against your [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] have been bested, there is no one left with the courage to test your powers. For the moment, you have won - a trip to the top of the Spire should provide an ideal vantage point for a survey of your victory.</DefaultText>
