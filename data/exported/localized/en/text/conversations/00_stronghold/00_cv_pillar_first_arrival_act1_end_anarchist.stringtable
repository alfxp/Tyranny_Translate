      <DefaultText>You blink away the last of the luminescent trails in your field of vision, the masonry of [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url] is replaced with wide open space in every direction, save for the slab of ancient stone beneath your feet.

High winds shove you, pushing you off-balance. The air is cool and thin - unsatisfying to your lungs.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Is this-?" Lantry looks out to the horizon, wide-eyed with excitement. "Yes, this must be the Spire! When was the last time-"

Lantry's eyes look down over the ledge. Dumbstruck by the vertical plunge, Lantry backs away from the edge. "I may need to retch."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This is certainly a change." The wind ruffles the feathers in her hair, and Verse quickly smooths them down. "A damn cold change." She peers over the edge. "Think I could land on my feet if I jumped? Not that it would matter for long." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Every way you look, mountains rise up along a distant horizon. The rivers and forest below bring to mind maps of [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url], and you quickly trace the Matani, the Irenev, and all the numerous waterways of the region.

Higher than you imagined it, this is indeed the pinnacle of the Spire at [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url].</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The questions stack up in front of you like a wall that feels too intimidating to cross. Before you can even begin to address them, there is still the matter of the war being waged on the ground below.

"I'm sure [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] will know your every thought when he devours your mind, but I'd be happy to deliver any parting words from the wicked, treacherous Fatebinder in the meantime."

She glances left and right. "I don't want to stand around watching you gloat, but I'm not exactly sure how to leave, either. Archon [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] will need my report."</DefaultText>

"Claiming the Spire for yourself is a crafty move, my vicious Fatebinder, but I wonder how long you'll be able to hold it? Hardly my concern.
