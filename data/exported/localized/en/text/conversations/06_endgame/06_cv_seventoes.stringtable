      <DefaultText>"Hail, Fatebinder. [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]The Voices of Nerat[/url] ordered me to answer any of your 'pestering' questions, so I guess that's what I'm here to do."

      <DefaultText>"I didn't want to see the whole war from the front lines, so the first order of business was to kill my gang boss and take his place. Easily done - he was a louse.

      <DefaultText>"So what do you want me to do about it, tell him to stop? The Voices does what he wants, and it's not healthy to get in his way." She huffs and shakes her head.

"I suggest you keep a low profile and follow your orders, because doing anything else can only land you on a pike next to those other rotters, eh?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She lowers her voice and glances around. "I don't know why he does it, only that it's been happening for a long time.

    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That's always been true, but it doesn't explain why he's killing so many." She shakes her head. "I don't think we're meant to understand his madness. He's an Archon, and no one doubts that the world looks like a different place through his eyes. Better to not try." </DefaultText>

      <ID>58</ID>

      <DefaultText>"That... that does make a crazy kind of sense. He's [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url], after all. I think we all get that there's more than one person under that helmet, even if we don't understand it or talk about it."

"He's more dangerous than any gang boss. If it was anyone else, I would tell you to keep your head down, but that isn't exactly possible for you, is it?"</DefaultText>

She looks off in thought for a moment before a smile creeps across her face.
