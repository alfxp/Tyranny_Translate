      <DefaultText>"Madman or no, he was under the protection of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' law when you dispatched him. But your position may prove relevant if the Fifth Eye meant you harm.

      <DefaultText>"Is that so? I haven't heard any similar testimony to suggest it. I am willing to concede that the chaos of the war was a contributing factor to the... moral confusion you showed on the battlefield."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So be it. After weighing the matter, the court finds you innocent of the charges."

"Normally, I would not accept wartime as a viable defense for your actions. However, the court is willing to look beyond the matter. [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url] had fallen to civil war and chaos in the scramble to resolve [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url].

      <DefaultText>"I can well imagine. The court has tried enough former and present soldiers to grasp the influence of mayhem. Disorder in the field can sway even the most rigid sense of morality." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The charge is murder of a subject protected under [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' law. The punishment is death. I hope you can answer for yourself, Fatebinder."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yet none of us are laughing. I would temper your pride and consider how your words reflect upon you, my pupil. You are reduced in the eyes of the court." [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] states impassively down, but you get the impression of a stern glare.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Fifth Eye was one of [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url]'s more troubling servants, to be sure. His wartime atrocities go beyond any rational number.
