      <DefaultText>She perks up at your response, sauntering closer to the bars of her cage. "Well, let's see. There was the time I killed an ox even knowing they were rare. Was an accident, but I still rode her right off that bluff." 

She strokes the bars as she thinks, reaching for something stronger. 

"I once spit on my mother. She was furious when she found me dabbling with earth-magics. I frigged my cousin when we were fifteen. Set a mountainside on fire. Oh, and [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] is my middle name."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Curse you, Fatebinder!" She rattles the bars of her cage, and the ground around you trembles. "Have you no human decency?! Curse the lot of you - the Chorus and [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], too! All of you be damned by the Archons! I hope crows eat your corpse on the battlefield."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Good choice, Fatebinder. I may not have any love for the Earthshakers, but they are mages and they don't deserve to be subjected to the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url]' punishments."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Given her training, I bet it was a matter of time until she was taken to see the Voices. And it's probably best that the Archon of Secrets NOT learn everything the Earthshakers know... that could only come back to harm everyone."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The sentence is time served? Aren't you in a charitable mood. This is probably for the best - she might have been scheduled for interrogation with the Voices... in which case, you just saved her from a fate far worse than death."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I've been in her situation... and I recall soliciting passersby for a mercy killing now and again. But legally, her knowledge and magical training is the property of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] - not something one can just discard on a whim."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You would leave her to rot?" Eb shakes her head with a scowl. "This isn't a question of culpability or a trial to settle - this is a prisoner asking for death... and I thought [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] forces had big, tumescent erections for killing their prisoners."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She balks. "Are you toying with me? I'd sooner die. It's only a matter of time before they toss me to the Voices - whether I serve them or not."</DefaultText>
