That won't stop the Censor from trying." 

"We still find reasons to fight for that flaming hole in the ground. There's something called the 'Silent Archive' that the Voices seems to think he can recover. Even if we pulled some books out of that inferno, I can't think of anyone but him who could read them." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Sages refused to bend the knee and give up their research. What's more, they defended the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url] by raining fire on the heads of our armies. Enough was enough, so [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] set the place to burn."

"The Sages must have laid some protection on the library, because it seems to burn without burning, you know? It just stands there in flames, not turning to ash like it should." </DefaultText>

She rubs her temple and sighs. "I can't speak to what drives the Voices, okay? He's an Archon, and he operates on a different spectrum of thought than the rest of us. Maybe the spike fits his style."

      <DefaultText>"The Sages refused to bend the knee and give up their research. What's more, they defended the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url] by raining fire on the heads of our armies. Enough was enough, so [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] set the place to burn."

"The Sages must have laid some protection on the library, because it seems to burn without burning, you know? It just stands there in flames, not turning to ash like it should." </DefaultText>
