      <DefaultText>"Go ahead and ask. Thanks to the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url], the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url] shakes worse than [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] banging his gavel. The local Beastmen don't seem to mind, but getting a good night's sleep is easier said than done." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I can only tell you what I know. [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] cast the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Stone to kill the rebellious Archon [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]. He's still out there in the wilderness, clinging to life...somehow." She shrugs. "Archons."

"His death throes and the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]'s power have changed the land, as you can see." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This used to be the realm of Azure, but that name doesn't suit it any longer. Only pockets of the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url] are still habitable, and even then it's mostly by Beastmen."

"[Plainsgate] is the last human settlement that I know of, aside from Cacophony. Still can't believe the town survived the third year of the war." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Many of them are former slaves whose masters fled or died during the war. As you can imagine, they have no love lost for humanity. The closest we usually get to conscripting them is offering assurances that they'll have the opportunity to kill more humans." She smiles. "They may be as dumb as rocks, but they recognize a good arrangement." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She scrutinizes you for a long moment, and then sighs. "To your question, a question - do I go around asking the Archon of Secrets dumb questions, and if I did, would any of the answers be remotely satisfying?" She looks at you with meaning and waits. "If the answer to either of those was 'no,' then don't bother asking me." </DefaultText>
