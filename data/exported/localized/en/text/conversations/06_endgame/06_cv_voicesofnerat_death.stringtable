      <DefaultText>Something about this strikes the Voices as funny. He begins to laugh. Short bursts develop into violent, uncontrollable spasms of insane joy. The Voices lets his hands fall from his robes. The very flames that defined him as a shapeless being whip into a frenzy, consuming him as they burn. You hear a distant, incoherent chorus of screams in the back of your head, but as quickly as it rises it fades to silence. The Archon of Secrets is extinguished before your eyes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This is not obstinance, I simply know more than I have time to explain. Chief among these details - the Archon of Ruin travels with the host of war, and disease will ravage the largely malnourished warrior."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Beastwoman's mind has become vast as open plains. Thoughts now flutter and squawk like fighting birds of prey. Is noisy!"

A sound like sharply gnashing teeth - wholly disturbing and inhuman - snaps behind her heavy, bronzed helm.

"But Beastwoman thinks new mind is not so bad. Like ancestors of tribes, have grown through magic into better predator."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Alpha is lucky Beastwoman is so loyal - and forgiving. Maybe will not rip Alpha's throat out today. Instead will think how hunting as new Archon can be good for Beastwoman."

If Nerat weren't such a wanton monster, I'd almost shed a tear for his passing - just think of how many tomes his minds could have filled... though I suppose most of it would have been sketches of torture and fornication."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Something about this strikes the Voices as funny. He begins to laugh. Short bursts develop into violent, uncontrollable spasms of insane joy. The Voices lets his hands fall from his robes. The very flames that defined him as a shapeless being whip into a frenzy, consuming him as they burn. You hear a distant, incoherent chorus of screams in the back of your head, but as quickly as it rises it fades to silence. The Archon of Secrets is extinguished before your eyes.</DefaultText>
