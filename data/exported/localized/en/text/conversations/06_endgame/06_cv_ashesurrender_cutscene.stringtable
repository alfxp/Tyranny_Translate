      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder, you have proven yourself a truer General than I ever was. I relinquish my hold over these women and men, and place them in your keeping." He sighs and stands at ease. "I ask only that you be good to them. They are far from home, and deserve treatment and leadership befitting their noble blood." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I received word before you arrived. Though the other Archons are vanquished, [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] sends another army to march on the Tiers. They make for the Mountain Spire, and chant for your blood. It seems that the Overlord will not tolerate competition. What are your orders?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Upon the North itself... I like this idea not at all, but I cannot deny that it is the right course of action. Do whatever you must to repel this advance. Go now - to [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url]!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If you intend to meet this offensive, I would not recommend doing so on the field of battle. The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] are capable, and I will continue to bolster their resolve, but I fear this warrants something more than a military gesture... something that would cause even [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] to pause."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A gang of your very own to order around? That's damn impressive - even if you consider they're a bunch of ironclad Northern crybabies. Give me a fortnight and I'll whip them into shape."</DefaultText>
