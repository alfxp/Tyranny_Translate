      <DefaultText>"I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this, Fatebinder. On the one hand, I don't have that terrible helmet on anymore. Other the other hand, I have a new one - and about fifty different voices all trying to speak at once. Would you all shut up?" The Voices of Sirin shakes its head.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I now have control of the army that was the bane of my existence for years - not to mention I am now the head of that army. I can make them do anything I want! This is incredible!

      <DefaultText>"Are you afraid I'm going to ask for your balls on a platter? Oh, that sounds like a good idea! No it doesn't - that's horrific! Who are you to criticize?"
