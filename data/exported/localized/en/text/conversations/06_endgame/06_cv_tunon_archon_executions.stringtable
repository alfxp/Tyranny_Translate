      <DefaultText>With a swift, jarringly shrill hiss of shadows, the Court's infamous assassin cuts from a swath of darkness, coalescing faster than the eye can follow into the form of a man - an Archon - dragging a thrashing, swearing and snarling second Archon with him.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No! Not like this! We were so close!" His legs bound by shadowy tendrils, [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] writhes in agony, his body contorting and folding in ways not possible were there solid flesh and bone beneath his rags. "Our memories, don't leave us! No, come back! We can't face this alone!" The Archons hands dart about his body, trying to cover the numerous rips in his clothes oozing green, luminescent energy.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The... the North will remember this indignity, you ungrateful farce! My legion will come for you, and there will be no shadow dark enough for you to hide from their justice!" A fresh wound going down Ashe's face drips blood into his beard, staining it deep red. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"YOU!" The accusation hits your ears in a dozen different voices. "We suspected this day would come but did not think you so craven, so despicable, so morally stunted that you would turn on such a dear, DEAR friend as us!"

The Archon's head begins to turn, the sound of screams and creaking metal fill the Court.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You will know my agony soon enough, peon of injustice!" Ashe spits in your direction, though it lands short. 

"Lest you think yourself wise with this pitiful droplet of command you wield, it is NOTHING to my centuries spent guiding the Northern legion. You're too enraptured with your own power to recognize why [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] has turned us against each other!" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He sighs, likely wearied from the fight but managing instead to simply sound put out. His eyes cut like heated blades into the spymaster. "Don't complain like you didn't see this coming. Didn't I warn you? If the kid wasn't your death, I surely would be."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He sighs, likely wearied from the fight but managing instead to simply sound put out. "Stop your blustering. Despite the incessant - and stupidly valiant - attempts of your soldiers to draw arms against me, I didn't kill any of them, did I? Well, aside from the accidental few..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] hauls a red-soaked, excessively dagger-struck Voices of Nerat forward onto his hands and knees, and spotting you, grins coldly, his own teeth tinged with dark clots. You notice his signature red-painted mask gleams a darker, wetter shade in places, dribbling down the side of his face and neck and pooling from other, deeper wounds to mix with the shadows on the floor, and he clutches a shattered arm to his chest. Patches of his clothing and skin are singed in places, and he snaps with two fingers a burnt lock from the back of his hair. 

"Damn near lost my eyebrows." He waggles them as if to make sure they're still there.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] hauls a heavy and hunched, excessively dagger-struck [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] forward onto his hands and knees. Spotting you, Mark grins coldly, his own teeth tinged with dark clots. You notice his signature red-painted mask gleams a darker, wetter shade in places, dribbling down the side of his face and neck and pooling from other, deeper wounds to mix with the shadows on the floor, and he clutches a badly mangled arm to his chest. With a grunt and a twisted wince, he pries the tip of an iron spear from between his ribs. He flips the shard between his fingers, studying it admiringly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A black secretion, heavier than smoke but softer than water, roils from the Archon of Shadows, the assassin of unknown centuries and untold kills, and he racks forward, suddenly, gasping a silent, shuddering breath as his power billows from him, tangible and consuming, suffocating until it has crept from him enough to choke at another. It - his executioner's embrace - is a burgeoning blot of nothingness, an expanse of endless shade that twists and shuffles, flares and snaps and swallows both substance and light as it slowly enshrouds a howling Voices of Nerat. Then even sound is consumed and there is nothing but a darkness where the Archon had kneeled. 

When, with a clench of Mark's fist the shadow sifts again into him, not even a trace of blood remains.</DefaultText>

The Archon of War hollers - a serrated shout of pain, and then even sound is consumed and there is nothing but a darkness where the Archon had kneeled.

      <DefaultText>The screams fall silent and a single voice, the tired tenor of a frail, aging man speaks.

"You had best hope [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] can slay me for good, otherwise, I will find you..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You worthless idiots, you're killing the wrong Archon! This whole civil war was Ashe's plan from the start! The Chorus has united the Tiers under one glorious, crimson banner! We alone have brought [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Peace, [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Glory! Slay us, and you will only anger the Overlord, for WE are [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' only true disciple! Were we not ordered to fight to see the strongest of us! Our ways are [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' ways, it is the rest of you who have fallen from grace!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Archon of War looks up at you in dawning comprehension. "Fatebinder! What have my good Northerners ever done but lay their lives down to serve your cause? How DARE you betray us now!" He strains against the binding shadows and bellows in rage. 

"The voice of the North renounces you, treacherous fiend! You will be hunted so fiercely that no corner of Terratus will give you succor!" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I make no pleas for the likes of you, since it is clear you possess no more humanity than [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url]." Ashe grimaces, and some of the blood running down his face stains his front teeth. 

"My legion broke and enslaved the Tiers to follow [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Peace, but in your greed you could not be bothered to remember our directive! [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] will have your head planted on the tallest monument in the North, even if you are the last of us! If you understood anything of command, you would see how we've been twisted against each other. So blinded are you by power that by the time you realize your error, you will be bleeding on the steps to the Overlord's throne room!" </DefaultText>
