      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder. You're no stranger to [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s court, but I prefer to spend as little time here as possible. In spite of these closed walls, I feel strangely... exposed." He glances up at [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url].</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You made us plenty comfortable in [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url], didn't you?" He winks. "It was nice to rest a spell and focus on local concerns for a change. Having a brothel on hand didn't hurt either." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Perhaps you should have waited until the two of you settled his debt before raising a hand against the Chorus! You'd betray us, then come demanding old favors? You can't possibly expect me to honor such a promise now? Would possible reason would I have to-!"

Looking back toward [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url], the Chorus warrior clears his throat, and steadies his posture.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Did he now?" Blood Mulch reaches into his satchel, his hand sorting through missives and scrolls. "Then I insist on paying his debt for him! How often does one have the chance to purchase leverage over Nerat's beloved puppet for mere parchment? I'll whisper about how he impinged the honor of the [url=glossary:crimson spears]Crimson Spears[/url] and made us look bad, maybe use it as an excuse to start a duel..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Eh, what possible reason would I have to make an enemy of the Court?" His hand moves toward his satchel and rifles through the contents. "If a mere bit of parchment will settle matters, it is no imposition. Besides, I rather like the notion of you flattering the Chorus by way of imitating our magic."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Why you killed Fifth Eye after all you did for us in [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] is something I'll never understand. Someday I'll fashion an instrument from your lungs and squeeze the answer out of you... but not today."</DefaultText>
