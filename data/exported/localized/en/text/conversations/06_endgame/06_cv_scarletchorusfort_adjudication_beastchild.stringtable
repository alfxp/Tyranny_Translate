      <DefaultText>"Didn't these thugs listen to Nerat's rules? There aren't many of them, so how hard can it be to remember the law against harming the young? Lucky for this cub, you're here to enforce the right rules." Lantry nods approvingly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This is all very heart-warming, but I wouldn't say for certain you've done this cub any favors - there's no telling the tribe will welcome it back - could reek of hairless or be the cub of a slain Alpha that has rivals waiting to kill it. All the same, far better that its pack decide its fate, and not the Chorus."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Now I'm not the authority on beasts - that's [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] Quillborne - but I think a young cub like this would go utterly feral if it were fostered by these thugs. I think there's more mercy to your choice than you realize."</DefaultText>
