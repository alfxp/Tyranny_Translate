The Archon wags his scepter at you, rotating from side to side in disapproval. "Think us ambitious or ruthless - both are fair criticisms, but do not assume we are so stupid as to so brazenly defy the Overlord. Just think for a second you sniveling twit, what need would WE have for holding onto such a thing? There is nothing it could teach us. Dear fool, you are chasing after nothing."</DefaultText>

With a quick flick of his wrist, the Archon's wrapped hands deftly sign a spell. An image of the Silent Archive hovers between you and the Archon, its form not entirely opaque at the edges.
