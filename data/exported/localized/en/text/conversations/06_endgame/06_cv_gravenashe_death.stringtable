      <DefaultText>For several minutes after the Archon's body hits the ground, Kills-in-Shadow howls wildly at the sky and claws a fresh, deep scar into her chest. She wears it proudly, her self-inflicted war wound, her mark of victory - her long awaited revenge. 

She licks the blood from her claws, her fingers, wrists, and palms and grins dangerously. 

"If iron-clads' Alpha crawls back to life, Kills-in-Shadow will happily mutilate elder for vengeance again. And again and again."

      <DefaultText>As the Archon falls, the soldiers ordered to the sidelines call out in protest, sorrow and disbelief. A thunderclap of departing magic cuts off their voices, and all goes quiet across Iron Hearth save for a vast and shared intaking of breath. The men and women of the Northern legion look among each other in bewilderment, and for an instant the training yard seems peaceful. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A new sound breaks the silence - at once unfamiliar, but as it grows in volume you associate it with the tearing of cloth. Then a legion soldier begins to scream, and dozens more quickly follow. Crying out in agony, the once-proud warriors clutch at their armor and yank off their helms in sudden panic. Pools of blood spreading under their feet make the source of the ripping sound all too clear - with the departure of the Archon's protection, their skin is coming undone along the seams of old battle wounds.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Whole units collapse to their knees as bones shatter and legs give out. The once-proud army is reduced to agonized howls of confusion as every wound taken in service to [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] is revisited. Soldiers crawl across the field to hold each other even as they nestle their own fallen entrails, and it takes far longer than it ought to for these cries to die down into a more permanent silence. </DefaultText>
