      <DefaultText>"Ah! Hello hello Fatebinder! I know why you are here, but I enjoy the banter of acting like I don't."

      <DefaultText>"Of all the secrets laid bare to me, there but one thing I do not know: the word to explain the joy of this predicament! Where once a lifetime of memories sat for me to peruse, I can now stroll through a different memory every minute and go a century without repetition!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You have my forgiveness, if that is what you are wondering. Did we not do all mankind a favor? For all the wisdom of the Archon of Secrets is better left in the hands of a creepy but benign old man than it was in the hands of that... mob mind known as Nerat."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Exploring! Did you know how many languages people spoke before [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] came to power? Neither did I!

      <DefaultText>"The human element is a strategic blindside. I understand much more than I ever thought possible... I see now the expedience and efficiency of sacrificing that old body of mine. That is not to say I am pleased you chose ME for this gambit... but I understand that, given the alternatives, I was the serf most easily discarded."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I never thought I'd recover from the sight of seeing the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Fire set the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url] alight. All that knowledge burnt to a crisp... But now! Now I have my own... not-so-Silent Archive crammed into my skull! I sometimes have to just pause and bask in the flood of memories and details."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"At least for the time being, all the others listen to ME! YOU HEAR THAT! It's a bit of a tempest of differing opinions in here, but I seem to be in charge."
