Long strands of white hair crown his head, trailing down to his shoulder blades, where the white hair loses shape and definition, becoming a shadowy mist. His red face paint and orange tattoos are the sole patches of warm color on his otherwise dark, ebony skin.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Anticipating his response, you attack before he can lunge for you. The sword is ridiculously heavy in your hands - a terribly impractical weapon, really - but the more you hack it, the more confident you feel. The sword itself seems inexplicably to simmer with a sentience, adjusting its weight to deepen or shallow the arc of your swing. It perfects your aim and adds bite to its own cut. It wields you as much as you wield it.

When you land a hit on one of Mark's twinned blades, cracking the metal clear in half, he holds a hand up to stay you, surprise twisting his smirk wry.</DefaultText>

You are holding the physical vessel of the Silent Archive, and while I doubt it was designed to be used outside of the chamber where it’s been housed for centuries, I’m told Sages who used to work with the Archive reported it would speak to them in their dreams – in the benign, educational sense, not in the ‘go crazy and eat your family’ sense of things. I’m sure it’s perfectly safe.”</DefaultText>
