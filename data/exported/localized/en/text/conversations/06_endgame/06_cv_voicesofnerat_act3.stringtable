      <DefaultText>There's Barik... he's everything the Chorus isn't - that could brutally irritate the Voices, or maybe round out his mind with new perspective. More likely, it seems Barik would be a thorny meal, fighting his way down with spectacular results.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There's Barik, whose loyalty to you is absolute and overwhelming. He's everything the Voices isn't - and you could be handing the Archon the missing piece to a balanced and brilliant mind. Perhaps the two would mutually annihilate each other, or if they did clash, the dominant Barik would certainly maintain his loyalty to you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There's Barik, and he's almost the antithesis of the Chorus ways. If sacrificed to the Voices, he might gift the Archon his balance and steady nerve. But Barik has turned his blade on his own kind, and that hatred and self-pity unleashed on the Voices could be too much fear and loathing even for the Archon of Secrets.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Verse is probably the only option the Voices wants, since he assigned her to watch you from the start. Or maybe he knows you know she's a spy and knows you won't pick her and she's the right choice. Or he knows you know he knows and so you ought to stick with Verse.

Unique among all who have followed you, she actively swore fealty to him years go. It could be argued that she consigned herself to a fate like this.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Offering up Verse is an option... but it's quite obvious she's been watching you from the start. Offering up her mind would mean teaching the Voices everything she's learned. Verse's loyalty to you is strong, but is it stronger than her bond to the Archon? If so, it's probable that Verse's loyalty to you might become a dominant characteristic of the Voices.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Having been all too eager to help, Verse is most certainly the Voices' spy, and this is his chance to harvest all that she's learned. He likely thinks you'll hand her over, as she's already his to some degree. At the same time, Verse has willingly bowed to Nerat, this was a fate that could have come to her at any time - of all your followers, she must have pondered this fate, she would be most prepared for it. And if her submissive obedience to you were to become a surface trait of the Voices' personalities... fear would be the dominant message.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You could offer up Kills-in-Shadow, though having seen no beastly personalities ever raise a chatter from the Archon, [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] only knows what might happen. Kills-in-Shadow doesn't think like any human mind, and that alien sentience could overwhelm the Archon, leaving him weak. It also stands to reason that Nerat might learn a Beastwoman's razor focus, develop whole new senses, and discover a renewed fondness for kinetic brutality.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You could sacrifice Kills-in-Shadow to the Archon. With no evidence of any of the Voices being Beastmen, [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] only knows what would happen. Kills-in-Shadow's mind is unlike any human, its alien ferocity could unhinge the Archon. At best, her overwhelming loyalty to you would take root in the Archon, giving you powerful sway, at worst, her mind would teach Nerat everything she knows about you, and everything she knows about killing.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You could sacrifice Kills-in-Shadow to the Archon, but [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] only knows what'll happen if a Beastman were to be claimed by Nerat, as the Archon hasn't exhibited beastly traits in the past. Kills-in-Shadow's rapacious mind could be a terrifying union with Nerat's - turning the Archon into an ever greater threat. On the other hand, Kills-in-Shadow fears you, obeys you, revels in your shadow... if an ember of dominance survived the feeding, she could very well undermine every shred of defiance the Archon could hope to muster.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A dangerous option would be handing over Sirin. Considering Nerat's naked lust for power, angering [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] is likely the only reason he hasn't consumed her already.

However, Sirin's hatred of [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] is her third most obvious feature. And she would likely sing-scream on her way down. But if her power surfaces in the Archon of Secrets, he won't be wearing her crown.</DefaultText>

Her hatred of the Archon is not in question, she will get dragged down kicking and screaming, hopefully with a song. However, depending on what parts of her personality surface, you could be handing the Archon her powers, or you could be planting a whisper in his ear that shatters his mind for good.</DefaultText>

Her hatred of the Archon is intense, and the decision to hand her over will no doubt crush whatever last bit of will she has left, but this could, in turn, give the Archon a poison pill - a broken mind that cracks the foundation. Or this could backfire catastrophically when her gift of song surfaces in Nerat and he's not wearing the crown.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You could hand him Eb, and in doing so hand him whatever mystical knowledge she knows in addition to all she's observed of you. It's a safe assumption she won't die easily, which means she could perhaps buy you time or weaken the Archon's will as she enters his mind kicking and screaming.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You could give him Eb, with the obvious risk of handing him more arcane knowledge, albeit a drop in an already large sea of mystic knowledge. Eb's loyalty to you could shine through, perhaps taking root in his unstable mind and leave the Archon your submissive servant. Or this could backfire, and Eb's mind will get along all too well with the other Voices, giving the Archon a willing conspirator against you, and giving Terratus centuries of ruin and debauchery.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You could give him Eb, though doing so most assuredly teaches him everything she knows about you and the mystical arts. Eb's headstrong personality could dominate the Archon, which could reduce Nerat to helplessness, or she might hate you so deeply for sacrificing her that she simply uses her last thoughts to encourage the Archon to slay you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You could always give him Lantry... he's probably close to death anyway. His passive, submissive tendencies could take over the Archon, giving you an edge.
