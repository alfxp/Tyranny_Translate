      <DefaultText>"Only to face hard labor or the executioner's axe! Would Ashe just forget about the caravans we hijacked? You think you can just sweep that under the rug?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The soldier softens her tone, but you can detect an undercurrent of something dangerous.

"I don't deny that you will answer to [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url]. His word is law, and you will find yourselves subject to his mercy."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The lieutenant barks a fatalistic laugh. "I'm already familiar with Ashe's mercy. He doesn't tolerate the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url], no matter if we had a decorated career. I could earn my name ten times over under [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url], and it wouldn't matter in [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url]'s estimate."

"As far as he's concerned, we're just brigands and pirates, and he grudges us for fighting in his war."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This one has a fair point. [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] never wanted the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] to join the invasion, and only ever saw us as an obstruction."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't question it for a moment. Tactics and training are enough to win a war. The passion of the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] is an empty promise."

He nods to the argument. "Looks like this is coming to a head."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm glad that someone thinks so. A girl can't help but feel that the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] don't get their due." 

She nods to the argument. "This is about to get interesting."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I hate it when [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url]'s lackeys prove me right."

      <DefaultText>He pauses with a look of bewilderment. "I've never known one of [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url]'s lackeys to be so... practical. I don't mean that as an insult. It's actually quite refreshing."

      <DefaultText>"A... a what?" He laughs. "Who in all of Terratus do you think I am that I would carry, what did you call it? This is rich. I'm telling the whole gang once I get back to Cacophony. After I deal with you." </DefaultText>
