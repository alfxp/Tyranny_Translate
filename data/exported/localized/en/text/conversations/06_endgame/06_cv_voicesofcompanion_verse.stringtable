      <DefaultText>"Just so we're clear, I don't see myself getting used to this any time soon. I'm a man, but I don't have the parts. I'm also a lot of other people, and none of them can agree on anything. A lot of the Voices' eccentricities are starting to make sense." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There's a very strong echo that never stops. Everything I hear just keeps traveling through my head without really dissipating. That's going to be a problem some day." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Funny thing, I always thought I would end up here. It seemed more likely that I would kill my way to the top, not possess the Archon of Secrets like a parasite. Live and learn." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Not yet, but I'd be lying if I said the notion hadn't crossed my mind. Being a boss means making the hard decisions, and that usually involves setting an example."

      <DefaultText>"But beyond that... I feel good. I miss my body, and let me tell you - I'm far from the first person to think that. But the green flames suit me more than I thought they would. Here's to hoping I can maintain this." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Verse chuckles to herself and sighs. Scratching the back of her head, she quickly realizes that her head is now a floating helmet, and stops. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Nerat heard rumor that there's a Spire in the middle of the ocean. He sent expeditions out, but none of them ever came back or sent word."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Nerat has memories of hundreds of different types of games, but years ago the rules all got mixed up. So there's this game being played in his head that's a twisted mash-up of every game ever invented." Verse clutches her head and moans. "Damn it, I lost again. The folks up here are really competitive." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She hesitates. "Boss, Nerat is closer to the surface than I thought. He... he just whispered something to me. I don't... I don't think anyone was meant to know what he just told me." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Nerat developed his own written language. He called it 'Mumblesense,' and there are incomprehensible chapters of his grand treatise scribbled in public areas across the North."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Nerat didn't know [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] as well as he thought he did. Wait... he didn't know that, so how do I?" Verse nurses her brow and shakes her head. "It's a disorganized mess up here, boss." </DefaultText>
