      <DefaultText>One of the horde members spits a blackish mix of herbs and phlegm at the Scarlet Fury's chest. "So they say to save their necks. But what good's the word of Oathbreakers and cowards?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We need the bodies you mewling pissers!" Face red, veins popping in her neck, the Scarlet Fury screams at the horde clustered before her. She waves her arms wildly as she shouts, almost dance-like in her agility, a blade clutched in each hand. "Unlike you cockered pignuts, these conscripts can survive a battle."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Furious and nearly faster than the naked eye can follow, she slashes a return strike. A splotch of red blooms across the offending spitter's chest, a match to her fresh sputum stain.

The crowd tenses like a coiled spring, ready to hurl themselves into a bloody fracas.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder, yes, Fatebinder, good of you to come along." The horde representative sneers and straightens himself taller, feeling self-important in the moment. "You just saved this Fury's neck."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A damn slew of Oathbreakers came crawling to us less than a fortnight ago. So we trussed the lot up like Beastmen for roast. Why should we welcome liars and defectors to guard our backs?" 

The horde member spits again but aims to the side this time, careful to avoid hitting the Scarlet Fury. 

"Come now, Fatebinder, you're a clever sort. Tell us your thoughts. We ought to throw them in the pit - let the lone survivor join us. It's the way of the Chorus. Right, boss?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hardly." She licks the edge of one blade and then uses it to smooth her newly mussed hair back. "Though the Fatebinder may yet stay me from smearing the ground with your blood."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I find that unlikely. Scarlet Furies don't surrender their necks to anyone without a fight. Your guts would have pooled around your feet before that happened."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We might be made of Tiersmen but we're loyal to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]. The Chorus ain't an open cattle call to any turncoat who's got a sharpened weapon and a decent pair of boots." He licks a sooty thumb in thought. "Toss them in the pit, boss, and I'll donate a share of the proceeds to you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The pit serves for merriment and to weed out fen-sucked weaklings like you," the Fury snaps at the horde member. 

Turning to you, she adds, "In this case it would be but a waste of resources. These are part of the splinter that held off the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] at [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url] for many months. We should integrate them into my unit of Furies."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Scarlet Fury cocks a nod of agreement. "I'll be sated just to have the squabbling done with. But we can't win a war with only fish-necked slatterns and a sea of blood. We need skilled fighters to wield our blades."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] doesn't lack for meat to throw at the enemy, but is always in need of experience. If you ask me, those with training should go to the Scarlet Furies. Anything less would be a waste of talent." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Scarlet Fury salutes you brusquely but with honor. "I'll see them assigned to a suicide mission at once. If the henpeckers can survive that, then they'll be worthy to serve my Furies."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The brutish man grins wide, and you can see he's missing several teeth on the left side of his mouth.

"Thought you might see it our way, boss. Tradition's a fine thing, after all. Keeps society moving."</DefaultText>
