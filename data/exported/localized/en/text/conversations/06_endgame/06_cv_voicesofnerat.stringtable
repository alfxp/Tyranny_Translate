      <DefaultText>"We once challenged the Archon of Winds to a footrace. We won by planting a lackey at the finish line beforehand, wearing a believable replica of our mask. We got to call her the Archon of Gullibility for a decade."

The Archon prattles on for several minutes, abruptly changing the subject just when your attention wanes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Archon talks at great length, leading you down a labyrinth of rhetoric at once alien and fascinating, sensible and mad. While the Voices could sway masses, you get the impression that he is just as accustomed to jabbering to himself in isolation. You leave the experience in numb disbelief, wondering what you've taken away from the exchange. </DefaultText>
