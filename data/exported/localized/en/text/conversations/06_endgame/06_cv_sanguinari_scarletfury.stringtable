      <DefaultText>"What is it? Make it good or make yourself scarce. I'm a little busy - stitching myself back together." Grimy fingers squeeze the edges of a long gash on her thigh together while she splashes amber liquid from a dirt-smeared bottle onto her wound. A flat bone sewing needle and black thread sit on a small, wooden stool next to her.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She barks a jerking laugh, inadvertently spilling more liquor from the bottle. "That's one thing to call him. Got to wonder what that horde-pustule thinks he's up to, sending a Fatebinder my way." 

She sighs and sets the bottle aside, spitting into her palm to lave the residual dirt away before groping for the flat stitching needle. 

"He's not wrong, though," she grunts as the needle pierces her skin. "I do need the help."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A squad of fucking Oath Bound got us up near [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url]. There was five of us Furies. Well, no, before that, it was nine." She falls silent, stitching sloppily but with concentration.

"Then, that quick, it was only me. I managed to take a couple down before..." She waves a grimy hand over the wound in explanation. "I didn't retreat. I ran. And it hurt to do it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I want you to find those Oath Bound and avenge my sisters." She bends over her thigh and snaps the black thread with her teeth. 

When she rises back, she takes the remaining length of thread, ties it into a jumbled knot and then swallows it. She rubs painfully at her chest. "I want them dead. And I want it to hurt first."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She nods but her attention seems to be taken by the act of testing herself, stomping her freshly mended leg and slapping at the wound. Without looking at you, voice strained, she answers, "See that you do." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She crosses her arms and nods slowly. Her chest expands as she takes in a deep breath, but when she blows it out, she sounds utterly empty. 

"Thought it'd made me happier to know - you know, that they got what they were worth. But [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]-be-damned if my leg doesn't just hurt."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Look, you did right by us, and I'm grateful." She laughs but it's short and hurt sounding. "And I don't often say that. If you're feeling generous, I have another favor to ask."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She glances up from her work, gauging you with surprise and curiosity for a moment. "War."

She twists to show you an older, gravelly and scabbed wound on her shoulder. Her arms are littered with pocks and scars.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Spit it out or fucking swallow it." She dabs at the long gash on her thigh with a sullied rag before liberally dousing the wound with amber liquor from a glass bottle. 

"Unless you're planning to stand there with your gob wide open while I sew myself up."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"One of my recruits was abandoned by his paramour on their way to joining the Chorus. He's upset about it, so I'm upset about it."

Slowly, she cracks the knuckles of her fist.

"Scouts spotted the ex headed to [url=glossary:blade grave]Blade Grave[/url]. If you happen to find the spineless little bastard, feel free to enact whatever justice you see fit."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I've had this a while." She tosses you a weathered scroll without concern. "Nabbed it off one of the 'shakers. Now we're even, you and I."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Suppose we did. What of it?" She pauses long enough to give you a discerning stare. "Suppose I and my sisters dragged some piss-livered Earthshakers into battle in Azure. Then fucking [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] came crying about how we got their mages killed. But you had our backs, I remember."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Never thought another could kill the Voices. What a terrible, wonderful boss you are, indeed." She slices the palm of her hand, quick and deep, and the blood flows freely as she outstretches her fist to you in offering. "Lead us to greatness and give us the spoils of this land, our Archon. And we are yours." </DefaultText>
