      <DefaultText>"Welcome back, kid. Amusing as it would have been to watch the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] drop, I guess I'm glad you lived."

[url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url], Archon of Shadows rouses from a faraway stare, turning to face you with a wry smile. Though he stands still, he seems to sift in and out of the shadows that shroud him.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But to draw blood from your allies...?"

The Archon flashes his teeth - flat and pearly white, a sharp contrast from the shadowed depth of his face. He folds his arms across his chest, hands resting against the bandolier of blades that span his waist.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'll see you later. For now, take this, and think on it."

His right hand darts forward, and a sharp pain rips through your ribcage. Your first thought is that you've been stabbed, but when you grab for the wound, it's only his fist you feel, gripped tight, a folded parchment tucked between his knuckles. You take the parchment, and the Archon finishes the hand off with a shove.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This?" He waves his left arm in the air, examining the blacker than black bracer, the strapping armlet that appears simultaneously solid as obsidian and diaphanous as a sigh - almost... a living, pulsing thing. "That'd be my Binding of Shadows. Want it?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With a gruff grunt, and some difficulty, he ratchets the bracer off - so it is solid, after all - and tosses it to you, one-handed. 

"Careful with it," he warns when you accept the gift. "Not only weapons can be double-edged swords."</DefaultText>

But when you shoot him a curious look, he raises his red-painted eyebrows in return, a secretive smirk quirking the right corner of his mouth. 

Clearly, he doesn't want you mentioning your clandestine meeting in the presence of the Court.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Archon stands silent and still. 

Arms crossed, he studies you for one heavily weighted moment. The seriousness of his gaze pins you in place, and his eyes burn brightly, backlit by the sheer, searing power of his magic. Then with a flick of a wrist, he flourishes a black-bladed dagger. You wonder if perhaps finally he's going to try to kill you. 

Instead, he flips the dagger on its handle and offers it to you. The gesture has a ritualistic feel to it. He is handing you one of his signature blades.</DefaultText>
