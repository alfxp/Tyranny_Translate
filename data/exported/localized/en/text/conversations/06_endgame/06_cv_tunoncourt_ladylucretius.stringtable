      <DefaultText>This well-dressed, older woman stands apart from the milling crowds of nobles. She stares off into the distance, oblivious to your approach until you're right in front of her. 

"Oh, greetings!" She offers a reserved smile. "Anda Lucretius, formerly of Thistlehome. You have the look of someone who belongs here. A Fatebinder, no doubt?" She nods.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A frown cracks her pleasant demeanor. "Like the rest of the frightened inbreds here, I came to see [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] and ask him to right a wrong." 

"My manor was destroyed during the conquest. I told the Adjudicator my woes, but we didn't exactly see eye to eye." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A great sigh deflates her. "It was my family's ancestral hall. The oldest stones dated back to the years when the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url] was naught but a dozen roofs and wagons clustering for warmth."

"Compared to the houses of the great lords, it was nothing special. Age had softened the wood, and its queer placement in the warehouse district set it apart from the finer grounds where lords and ladies strolled for amusement. It was a mess, but our mess all the same." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Collateral damage happened."

"When the Adjudicator cast his judgment on the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url], he destroyed the districts of the corrupt merchant kings - their manors, their counting houses, and yes, their warehouses."

"Aged, dignified Thistlehome collapsed as a massive sinkhole opened under her foundation." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url]'s laws may not have been perfect by [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' standards, but my family followed them with respect, and never took a copper ring more than we deserved." 

"I can't help but feel that my estate was not the criminal [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] had in mind during his sentencing." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You must understand that Thistlehome predated the city districts. My grandmother was also a persistent woman. Merchants storing salted cod and lamprey eggs on the adjoining grounds were no cause for her to budge from her spot."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That's the question, isn't it? I appealed to the Adjudicator, thinking he would see reason. After considering my case for all of eight seconds, he awarded me a belt of rings and a plot of land on the outskirts of the city."</DefaultText>

      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>"[url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] told me to build anew and start farming. Farming! Can you believe that?" She shakes her head. 

"It's not even that I'm opposed to the labor, but we're in a war. I can't have the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] breathing down my neck, raiding my crops, and... and [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] knows what else." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I come from a long line of smart, ring-savvy merchants, but even I can't reconcile [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s justice with [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' law. There's something... wrong about it all." 

"Maybe [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] knows something I don't, or maybe..." she trails off, shaking her head in doubt.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"People come here for justice. They usually get a version of it, but it's [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s version, not theirs. Half of the time, they don't even get what they wanted out of a ruling in their favor."

She shakes her head. "The deed to a farm, for instance." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I..." She regards you with tired bewilderment. "I suppose that will teach me to confide in an agent of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], won't it? All of the court's great claims of objectivity aren't worth the rags on my back. Lesson learned twice over." 

Lady Lucretius cuts a belt of rings and send them skidding across the floor. She aims a look of quiet intensity your way.</DefaultText>

      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>She sighs. "Of course all of that has changed. Thistlehome is no more, and my name has none of its former weight.

      <DefaultText>"And isn't that the most backward cycle of ring-trading I ever heard? But it casts a light on something I've been thinking while I stand here, watching [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] go about his business." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No! It's not that at all. I'm... I'm saying that I don't understand [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' law as well as I thought I did. Maybe none of us do."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Not to put my own ignorance on display, but if more people knew how [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' laws worked, they might not come here seeking a ruling at all... even a fair one."

"[url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] is a servant of law, but he's the Overlord's vassal as much as any of us. Sometimes it seems like he uses his position to twist everything in the Empire's favor. We're just pieces on a board, and he can move us wherever the law justifies that we stand."

      <DefaultText>She sighs. "I suppose not. The [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url] used to have the laws of woman and mankind, but now we have the laws of the Overlord."

"Three years since [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] set up shop in the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url]. We're still getting used to our new masters, and figuring out what we can and can't ask of them."</DefaultText>
