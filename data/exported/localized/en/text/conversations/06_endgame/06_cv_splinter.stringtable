      <DefaultText>"Got a couple of storms brewing. A number of defectors from resistance groups around the Tiers have come to swear fealty to the Voices. Or they were coming before they were captured by [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] troops en route."</DefaultText>

      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The defectors need to be rescued and then properly brought into the fold. We can't have them singing our secrets before they've even learned the damn song, now can we? But we'll decide what to do with them once they're under our care again."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There's also the matter of a merchant in the southern Tiers who's been stupidly vocal concerning our recruiting methods. From him I want his fat, puckered lips - kidding! Just silence him, however you want to do it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So the whispers say. You let the heads roll, but it's just as well. To be captured without much fuss - can't say it made them seem too desirable."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"So the whispers say. Set them loose did you? I suppose you really have a soft spot for us Chorus after all. They'll make fine recruits, assuming they survive the pits."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"On behalf of the Chorus, I do thank you for your help, Fatebinder. I've certainly benefited from it." He salutes you followed by a mock bow. "Safe travels, and all that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Voices doesn't even leave a body. How do you think he does that? No, on second thought, I surely don't want to know." He licks his tongue over his teeth, scratches his cheek. "And you did not hear so much as a whisper from me." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I guess it was a piece of a chair. At least as long as my forearm. My mate, Abscess, had whittled it up for weeks to stab it in my spine. Only it didn't kill me though, just give me this damn limp."

He rubs the spot on his lower back toward the right side, wincing either from the pressure or the memory.

"I wouldn't say it was a shoddy weapon. It ended her good and dead when I stuck it in her throat."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He throws his hands up yet somehow manages to look unconcerned even as he attempts to appease you. "Okay, I won't nick you on the deal, and you don't nick me with that blade. I swear to the Voices, you Fatebinders are always so relentless. Here, take the rings."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yeah. I wouldn't go so far as to say 'husk' because that would be overly-dramatic, but they certainly don't look quite right."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So the Voices speaks no more, and you're the new, big boss. Congratulations or some such, I suppose." He grins, rot-toothed and wide. "Hold fast to that title, Archon. Only demotion in the Chorus is death." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Never seen the camp so... dead." He wraps a weatherworn tatter of a sail around several wood handled weapons and tosses the bundle into a crate at his feet. It's clear from the clutter - he's packing up shop. "But with the Voices gone quiet, how could the Chorus continue its clatter? A good question, but one I haven't an answer for."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Only a fool waits to be slaughtered. Without the Voices, the Chorus is nothing but chaos. Kill who you want - take what you desire. Live to fuck another day, if you can." He grunts as he hefts his crate from the ground. "There's better places to pillage than here. Whole towns out there. And it's our promised fate to take them."</DefaultText>
