      <DefaultText>"I'll see you later. For now, take this, and think on it."

His right hand darts forward, and a sharp pain rips through your ribcage.

Which is great, if you don't mind the occasional Bane attack. The Spire certainly improves the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url]'s artisanal ability.
