      <DefaultText>"I'd like to say it was fun while it lasted."

Palming two daggers nearly faster than your eye can follow, he flickers and morphs, dissolving into the darkest of shadows in order to strike.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Eventually, one of us has to bow or break to the other. You should know by now that rulership isn't my style - I've no desire to win this little pissing match or collect your fealty. At the same time, when you pester me with questions like that, the idea of serving you becomes more and more irritating."

He flicks the edge of his blade back and forth, catching it in the light.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A shadow steps toward you. The edges take form and substance - a familiar arrival.

But rather than greeting you, the Archon slowly circles around, examining you with a discerning eye. 

Finally, he nods and stops before you, offering you one of his signature blades. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Really? This is how you want to play it?"

The dagger dissolves into nothingness in your hand, a mere shadow of the weapon. [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] palms two, fresh blades, and cracking his shoulders, dissipates seamlessly into the darkness.</DefaultText>
