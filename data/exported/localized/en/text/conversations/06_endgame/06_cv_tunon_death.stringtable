      <DefaultText>"You... you have learned much in your few years, Archon. Striking down our kind is more than the swinging of a blade or pounding of a mallet."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Perhaps I underestimated you. You... you wield the talents of the Overlord. Better that you use them to end your life, because [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] will dismantle everything you attempt to build. Good... luck." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I... I would speak with you one last time. We should not allow a formality as trifling as death to stand between master and pupil. The void can wait." Though his face reflects no visible change, you nevertheless get the impression that [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] is wincing.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] is coming. An army swifter and more dangerous than [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] and [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] combined makes for the Tiers, propelled by the Overlord's will. Your efforts here are wasted. You cannot halt this advance."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I have only this to say... justice is more than words on parchment or tablets of law. Some may call it arbitrary or needless, as if mere words could diminish its importance. There is greater meaning behind such things than you can ever know."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Justice has sustained me this long. [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] is not ignorant of that power, and I suggest that you remember what I imparted. Let my example show the way to greater truths about authority, and the root from which it stems."

      <DefaultText>"There are [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' laws, and the laws that govern our natural order. I fear they often... diverge. I have broken the laws of nature for too long. Life should end in its course, and this is my time at last." Through the pain, you can hear something like a satisfaction in [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s words. </DefaultText>

Sketching what remains of the Archon of Justice, Lantry's hand moves with hurried excitement. "I bet he never thought he'd be done in by one of his own Fatebinders.
