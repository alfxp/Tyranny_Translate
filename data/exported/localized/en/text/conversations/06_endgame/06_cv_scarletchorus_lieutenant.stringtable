      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder. Every moment that we waste, the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] threaten to gain a foothold in the Tiers. Let's cut their legs out from under them, one by one." He smiles, revealing rows of black teeth. 

"First things first, let's clean up our rank and file. One of the gang bosses lost his nerve, and we need an example made."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There's still work to do before the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] can dominate this sorry nation - but we're off to a good start. Since we began conscripting from the locals, our numbers have never been greater." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Now, I don't get to say this very often - but [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] is pleased with all the work you've been doing. You should know better than anyone that the praise of an Archon is hard won. What's more, the gang bosses are starting to notice you - as are their recruits. Making quite the little name for yourself, aren't you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The punishment is death." His dirty grin widens. "But since he served us well, his reward is the pleasure of dying in battle. No one who crosses the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] could ask for more." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The boss you're looking for is Rending-Hound, a Beastman we conscripted during the conquest. He's as strong as the base of a Spire, and just as dumb."

"We thought that inviting him into the fold would get more Beastmen on our side, but the tribe considers Rending-Hound an outcast. He's useless to us now. Any questions?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Track him down and butcher him like the animal he is. Bring us his necklace for good measure. We'll display it to put some fear in the troops."

      <DefaultText>"Before you start complaining - you dealt with Rending-Hound, so now his tasks are yours. That's the price of advancement in the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url]." He nods. "We all have to pull our weight."

"Go out and track down the gang bosses. Find out what's keeping them from falling in line, and get them back here." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He looks at you for any falsehood, then shakes his head. "You want to know about me? I got conscripted a few years before the call to war took everyone south.

      <DefaultText>He opens his mouth and starts to respond, but stops himself and turns to [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url]. The Archon passes him a barely imperceptible nod. When the lieutenant turns back to you, his forehead is dappled with sweat.

"Keep your trophy, then." He pauses once more. "But you would do well to remember yourself and to whom you speak."</DefaultText>
