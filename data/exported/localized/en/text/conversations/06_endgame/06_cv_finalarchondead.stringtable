      <DefaultText>The echo of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s gavel falling from his hands resounds throughout the Court far longer than it ought to. Just as it seems that the ringing in your ears will never end, the hall of justice takes on an eerie silence not heard since the Adjudicator claimed his seat.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Whatever else has happened, one fact remains clear - the world is short an Archon, and Terratus strains with the discomfort of filling that gap. As the only figure of true power to witness this absence, it only seems fitting that you are made to occupy it as the last ruling Archon of the Tiers. </DefaultText>
