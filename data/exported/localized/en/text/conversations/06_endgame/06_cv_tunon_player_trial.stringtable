"The Court is a lawful expression of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' will... as is an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]. One has cancelled the other out, which is not, in and of itself, unlawful?"

"Though I have no wish to disparage the dignity of the Court by association, we have reason to believe that our colleague's objectivity is... let us say, 'compromised.' Such a claim likely comes from self-interest rather than honest opinion, and should be taken with suspicion." </DefaultText>
