      <DefaultText>"Just what we need - a Fatebinder of the Courts. Look, I understand my rank, but I can't just bite my tongue when boss-man Dirge thinks to get away with a crime of such proportions - without bribing me first."

      <DefaultText>"Eager?" The horde member rubs at the back of his neck, ill-at-ease. "I mean, I'm just thinking - on account of Dirge being a true criminal under [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' laws - he really isn't fit to lead this gang no more.

      <DefaultText>He crosses his arms over his chest, simmering with indignation. But as he scowls, a hint of worry flickers across his furrowed brow. 

He licks his lips before entreating you to dismiss the complaint against him. "Like I'd be dumb enough to risk my entrails scurrying about some fusty ruins. Think I don't know why they're forbidden? Scouring the Oldwalls is just asking to incite [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' wrath - and I've got no death wish either from the Bane within, nor [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] above, nor a Fatebinder of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] before me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>For a moment, you can see the whites of his eyes as he blinks away the shock, but it's quickly replaced with fury.

"You damn well know, I didn't go in!" 

He cocks his head to you, face flushed red as he explains. "The thing is, me and Wrath had been chasing a [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] clear from Lethian's. I guess she figured she wasn't going to slip us, so she made a beeline for this breach in the Oldwalls. I know the law, so I wasn't about to follow her in." 

He wets his lips before continuing. "But I'd also be loath to let an enemy of the Overlord slither free. So I cornered her before she could make it past the breach.

      <DefaultText>"Knew you wouldn't let him get away with so brazenly breaking [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' laws. Good call, Fatebinder."

      <DefaultText>The gang-boss glowers but nods his understanding. "I'll pay the rings. But I've only got half of it on me. I can get you the rest later." 

He tosses you a heavy string, then spits at Wrathrot's feet. "Damn you, Wrathrot. Don't think this is over. I'll be taking that price out've your hide."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So you're saying you didn't chase that [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] right into the Oldwalls? That's what you're saying, boss? That you followed her but didn't go in?" Wrathrot splits a vile grin, lips oozing wider with each accusation. He runs a tongue over his teeth, barely containing his violence and resentment.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The gang-boss cocks his head to you, face flushed red as he explains. "The thing is, me and Wrath had been chasing a [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] clear from Lethian's. I guess she figured she wasn't going to slip us, so she made a beeline for this breach in the Oldwalls. I know the law, so I wasn't about to follow her in." 

He wets his lips before continuing. "But I'd also be loath to let an enemy of the Overlord slither free. So I cornered her before she could make it past the breach. THIS asshole here's the one who slit her damn throat as I held her down. Now he's saying he watched me waltz right into the Oldwalls - without him?" </DefaultText>
