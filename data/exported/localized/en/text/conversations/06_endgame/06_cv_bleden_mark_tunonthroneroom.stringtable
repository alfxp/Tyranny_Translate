      <DefaultText>Shadows pool and merge briskly together. Long wisps like blades billow, twist, and snap as [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] emerges from the coalescing darkness. 

Against the expectations of the room, his deadly focus falls not to you - but to [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url].</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Slowly, he swivels his head to the side, staring at you with a single-minded intensity. His muscles coil tightly - he is a black adder poising to strike.

      <DefaultText>He flicks his gaze to the Beastwoman, a creature born from darkness, a ruthless, apex killer with an affinity for shadows much like himself.

He smiles, baring his flat, white teeth. But it's not a friendly gesture.
