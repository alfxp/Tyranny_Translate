      <DefaultText>One of the more timid horde members ducks her head, scratching through the back of her hair. "Are you sure? I've heard bad things about inviting the Court's judgment.

"He stole whole cartfuls of rings and polished stones after Azure crumbled. We dug the items up, hauled bags of them all over the place, but got none of the payoff.

      <DefaultText>"That's when I snuck out from under the straw bedding." She runs a hand over the bloody markings on her skin, long dried but worn out of pride. "Arsen never did anything - eat, sleep, or shit - without a weapon, but we'd hobbled him enough that I was able to hack him to ribbons. Eventually, he started crawling for the flap of the tent."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She cracks her neck and squares her back, eager to relay her part and be done with it. "We all got tired of being cut on and watching him torture Nils. So when Requiem suggested the plan, I was eager to lure him into our trap."

She glances around and speaks a little softer as she continues, "Had to use my finest hooch - I brewed it in a bronze boot I found on the battlefield - but after a couple hours, I had him nice and relaxed. Stripped him of his armor. And distracted him after that."</DefaultText>

"I slit Arsen's throat to end it, dismembered his body, and spent the night scattering his bits between the fighting pit, two latrines, and a salivating Beastman. It was bloody and long work.

She obliges with a stern shout. "Let this waste be a lesson to us! We didn't kill Arsen for his damn rings. At this point, it's best to burn it all to the wind."

Satisfied with her assessment, the others nod and disperse. Calamity Gin tosses an arm over Gnashing Nils's stooped shoulders and Chaos follows close behind.
