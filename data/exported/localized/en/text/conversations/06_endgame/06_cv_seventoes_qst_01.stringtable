      <DefaultText>"Go ahead. Can't have you doing the Voices' bidding uninformed. He's not what you'd call a perfectionist - at least by our understanding of the word - but he likes to have his orders understood." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Storms tore it up something good - made it all but unrecognizable from old Stalwart. That hasn't stopped fanatics like the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] from rallying as if their old country still existed." 

"Last I heard, they've had [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url]'s daughter in chains since the last year of the conquest. I don't know how Stalwart treats its prisoners, but the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] are known for taking a beating. There's no telling what she's endured."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No telling, these days. The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] are nominally in control but the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] act like they never lost the war... of course, their leaders are holed up behind the walls of Sentinel Stand. So no matter how you cut it, there isn't much to rule - unless you want to be queen of a tornado... which doesn't sound half bad."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If she's anything like her father, then she's as stubborn as a wall and nearly half as smart. All that aside, they say she fights like a charging Beast. We heard about her even before the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] marched south. She's got a temper something fierce, and an independent streak that's always been at odds with her [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] roots." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The only good thing about the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] is that you can see it from plenty far away. A massive tornado built of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' frustrations swirls around Sentinel Stand, the seat of power in old Stalwart. They say that it'll only exhaust itself when the last of Stalwart's ruling family is dead. Can't say if that's true or not, but it makes for a good story, eh?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Used to be known as the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url]. It's not a pretty sight since [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Fire burned up the old [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] fortress and made the treasure inside damn near unreachable to anyone. That won't stop the Censor from trying." 

"We still find reasons to fight for that flaming hole in the ground. There's something called the 'Silent Archive' that the Voices seems to think he can recover. Even if we pulled some books out of that inferno, I can't think of anyone but him who could read them." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hey, what do I know? Considering the place is a library, I guess we're talking about a book. Or... many books."

      <DefaultText>"The Sages refused to bend the knee and give up their research. What's more, they defended the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url] by raining fire on the heads of our armies. Enough was enough, so [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] set the place to burn."

"The Sages must have laid some protection on the library, because it seems to burn without burning, you know? It just stands there in flames, not turning to ash like it should." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"One of the Voices' gang bosses. She takes the duty of controlling information, as if the Archon couldn't do it himself."

"My guess? She wants to be the next Archon of Secrets, so she's positioning himself as the middle-woman between the Voices and any words of wisdom he considers valuable. We'll see how long that lasts."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Before the conquest, it was a small trading post that you could pass by without regrets on the way to somewhere better. With scared folks running off with their possessions and rings, it's become something greater - a city, almost." 

"[url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] sent his [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] smiths there to work on their weapons in private. Between that and the refugees, [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] has gotten more attention over the last three years than the last three centuries.

      <DefaultText>"They have a Master by the name of Zdenya. I only know the name because I heard the Voices babbling it as he spun some plan or another. She's supposed to be a rare talent. I couldn't tell good iron from bad, myself." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Not much to tell. Mostly families live there, but some groups have to share space and pile on top of each other for a place to rest their head. During the conquest, we'd relieve the pressure by swooping in and taking a few locals for the army, but it's getting to be chancy with the civil war and all." </DefaultText>

"Don't forget to report back to the Voices when you're done. And if you find Ashe's daughter, try not to kill her. Corpses are useless to the Archon." She pauses and frowns. "Mostly useless."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That uh, certainly won't be necessary. The Silent Archive is the centuries-long passion project of the School of Ink and Quill - a magical repository of knowledge that generations of Sages have built upon over the ages. And no, I was never allowed to see it, thirty years of service and I still need another decade to be considered for the initiation."</DefaultText>
