"My colleague here makes a decent, if foolhardy, point. Our office has expended a great deal of effort supporting the cause of this war, but the Archons have..." she coughs into her fist, "underperformed. This might be a good opportunity to evaluate our options moving forward." </DefaultText>

"I will... entertain this notion, student. Be sure you don't try my patience or waste the Court's time. Any effort to impede our lawful progress will be met with swift retaliation, is that understood?" [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] releases a deep breath and looks to you once again.</DefaultText>
