The Fifth Eye offers a short, mocking bow to Lantry. "By the customs set forth by [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url]... you are free to go, old man. Brag to your grandkids that you fell afoul of the Chorus yet lived to tell the story."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That is a reasonable point. You've been more than fair to the Chorus in the past - certainly a better ally than the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] have been."

He nods vigorously, waving his hand at the prisoner to signal his release. "It's your lucky day old man - you get to tell the Fatebinder everything you know."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes yes!" He grunts and stammers as he struggles to wrest free from your grip. Once you release him, he shuffles to regain his composure.

"You two!" Dusting himself off with one hand, he waves to two nearby conscripts with the other. "Release the [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url]. He's the Fatebinder's problem now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"When is a trial by combat ever a terrible idea?" The Fifth Eye chuckles a hearty laugh, waving his hand dismissively. "If you are worried for his safety, fight on his side - the more blood shed, the more certain the verdict. You are our guest, the least you could do is honor our ways."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With a shake of his head, the Fifth Eye gives you a shrug. "Is it not obvious? If he is a true enemy of the Overlord, he will perish by our blades. If he can survive then he is strong, and the strong lead, thus his crimes will not be crimes, but simply the actions of the mighty. What's not to understand? This isn't alchemy."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The voice comes from another prisoner tied up next to Variah - an older gentleman with the quills, ink vials, and parchment scrolls one finds on the Sages of the School of Ink and Quill.

Ink smudges cover his cheeks, temples, and ears. His clothes appear charred, and between the rips of the fabric you spot burn scars along his arms. Despite being emaciated and tied to a post, he offers a beaming smile.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well let me see...I can't... umm... hmmm...Uh huh..."

      <DefaultText>You unroll the parchment and see a message of modest length written with professional, albeit hasty, penmanship. The Tiersmen speak the Canto just like the Northerners, but they have a half dozen different ways of writing it - this particular script is unknown to you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A low growl rumbles from underneath his mask as he mulls over your comment.
