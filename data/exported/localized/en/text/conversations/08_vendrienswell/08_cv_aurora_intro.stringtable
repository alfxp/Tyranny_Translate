The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] warrior claps her gauntlet to her breastplate, the traditional salute of her legion.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I bid you a welcome return to [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url]. The altitude is still dizzying, and the locals still revolting - doubly so this time around, as they've pissed on [url=lore:edgering_aurora_react]that peace accord you offered them[/url]. Edgering Pass is still as you remember it - I was hoping to have the warriors celebrate your return with a proper feast, but I'm told you have places to be."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Sorry I don't have a proper welcome for the [url=lore:edgering_aurora_react]Queenslayer[/url]. Perhaps if I weren't so short-handed, I could have made preparations - but no bother. We are honored to have you all the same, and I look forward to seeing the [url=lore:oathbreaker]oathbreakers[/url] lose their cool at the sight of you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] is leveled against us?" Her eyes widen with fear, her posture slackens. "But the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] prevents us from taking action! Why would the Overlord punish both of-" She clears her throat with a sigh. "Forgive me, it is not my place to question. We should have conquered the enemy within weeks of arriving in the valley - the delay reflects poorly on all of us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"More runners... third time this week. The oathbreakers keep trying to send messengers through the mountains to gather help from outside the valley." She points over to the collapsed path by which you arrived. "But they're a bit too late for that now. Come, let's show these [url=lore:oathbreaker]oathbreakers[/url] a good fight."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If following orders and killing the locals will save our lives, you don't have to tell me twice! And I sure hope you don't have to tell the Archons twice either."

She looks at you with a nervous smile. "Still... this is all coming from the Firestarter - the Fatebinder that made fire bubble up from the soil and reduce the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url] to ash... so you'll forgive me if I'm still terrified all the same."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Your words sting, but they are not false. The soldiers stand ready, yet the Archons never issue the charge. If anything can force them to act, it will be the Overlord's [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I've seen why they call you Stormcaller! I saw first-hand what happened to Stalwart for their refusal to fight. Now we are the ones guilty of stalling and offending the Overlord!"

She clears her throat, blinking quickly as she recovers her composure. "I'm sorry, as you said, if we follow [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' will, there is no need for concern - as ever the case."</DefaultText>

That must have been a grim task, proclaiming an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] against [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]... but someone had to deliver that traitor's execution."

"I sure hope you're right, and that all we need to do is get our asses in motion and put down this uprising. Let's hope this lights a fire under the Archons to agree on a plan."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A nervous smile creeps over her as she waits for a response that doesn't arrive.

      <DefaultText>"Your senses see more than mine, good Fatebinder - I do not pretend to know much about such things. But if that was [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' magic and you're here on important business... well, you don't have to be the Archon of Secrets to guess that you're here to proclaim an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]. What does [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] have in store for the enemy? Ten years of festering plague? An [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of twisted bones?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes, well..." Her eyes shift to the side. "There has indeed been little goodwill between our armies, and you are right - when we act as we do, what choice do we give the Overlord?"

She takes a deep breath, nodding as she exhales. "And you are right, I should not cast blame so freely, especially not when talking to a servant of justice - my apologies."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"From what we've learned from the other prisoners, the runners are instructed to escape the valley and drum up support for the oathbreakers' cause elsewhere in the Tiers."

Aurora shrugs. "I don't know who they think will listen to their pleas. We've smashed every army, fortress, and self-proclaimed ruler these lowborn Tiersmen have to offer. Perhaps they think the wild Beasts will rally to their side?"</DefaultText>

She shakes her head, holding back a chuckle. "Of course, [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] and his inner circle were all suggesting peace talks back in the day. Suppose hindsight makes a fool of us all."</DefaultText>

I've slain how many of these southnobs, and still no nickname."

The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] warrior clears her throat, forcing a smile to her face. "If the Archon of Justice sends a Fatebinder [url=lore:edgering_aurora_react]who favors the ways of the Scarlet Chorus over the sanctity of the legion[/url], perhaps that's a sign of who's to be chosen to rule these worthless Tiersmen."</DefaultText>

[url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] and [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] can agree on nothing - least of all battle plans to wipe out the [url=lore:oathbreaker]oathbreakers[/url].

By [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' will, most of our old invasion force still lives, but most of us have been scattered across the Tiers, reassigned as needs change. I miss those days... when there was so much battle ahead of us, so much glory still to be won."

"Here's hoping you can convince the Archons to settle on a plan to crush the [url=lore:oathbreaker]oathbreakers[/url]. That is why you're here, right?"</DefaultText>
