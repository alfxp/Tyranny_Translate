      <DefaultText>"[url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] iron is [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s responsibility. Why is this the first I'm hearing of it?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Keep your voice down!" Isotanis flinches and lowers his own. "[url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] doesn't want to cause a panic or pass any information to the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url]. Best case scenario, the iron tumbled off a boat and is rusting on a riverbed. Worst case... it ends up in enemy hands." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I appreciate that! As does the Great General - more than you might guess. Maybe he isn't quick to offer his thanks to outsiders, but I know he'll be grateful for your help. It would be a boon to the war effort if our iron was recovered." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Bronze will do in a pinch, don't get me wrong. It can take a beating and get bent back into shape, unlike this stubborn iron we have here." He glances at a pile of his work with dread. "And we always have plenty of tin and copper lying around, so supplies aren't the problem." </DefaultText>

      <ID>61</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm afraid so... the last shipment sent down the Matani went missing near Echocall Crossing, and I'm afraid we won't be seeing any more now that the valley is sealed." </DefaultText>

      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Only the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] smiths can make the stuff. They know the secret of iron - all I can do is mend and maintain their craft. It takes a master - nay, an artist - to make a piece of iron fit for an indomitable soldier such as a [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <ID>66</ID>
      <DefaultText>He shrugs and dismisses you with a quick wave. "Have it your way, Fatebinder. I was under the impression you had come to help us. Maybe I was wrong."</DefaultText>

      <ID>71</ID>
      <DefaultText>He glances to a crate beside him and points to a small set of notches on the wood. "You see that? That is how we tell apart our iron shipments from the rest. Inconspicuous so people don't go snooping around. You'll want to keep your eye out for these. Good hunting."</DefaultText>

      <ID>75</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You expect me to be pleased - a village, burned... and you say they had the iron? Fatebinder, we needed that to keep our troops outfitted! What are we going to use to block the Vendrien spears, driftwood?!" He clutches his brow and shakes his head. </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>77</ID>
      <DefaultText>"More scrap... damn. I'll relay your findings to the Iron Marshal. I can tell you she won't be pleased, but maybe she'll sleep better knowing that we can't do anything about it... except kill some Vendrien swine."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>81</ID>
      <DefaultText>He sighs and wipes a line of sweat from his brow. "If you don't mind, I have to beat the dents out of scrap metal until it passes muster." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>82</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Appreciate your help, though it's a shame we couldn't recover the iron." He frowns with uncertainty. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His eyes widen to the size of saucers. "If I knew you had come to grant wishes, I would have met you in Edgering Ruins with a list!" </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>89</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Burned Echocall, did you?" He shakes his head. "I won't say the oathbreakers didn't deserve what they got, but without the village or any survivors to tell of it, we'll never recover our missing iron shipment..." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>93</ID>
      <DefaultText>He takes another hard swing at the already broken sword, this time smashing it to pieces. "Of course, you would know about all those two-faced murderers since you defended them."</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>96</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No matter. The Court has its own concerns, I'm sure. Right now, I'm more concerned with the iron shortage."</DefaultText>

      <ID>97</ID>
      <DefaultText>Isotanis curses the air as a blade of thin iron breaks in half beneath his hammer. "Repairing weapons with scrap isn't exactly why I got into this craft, but our supplies are spent." He wipes the sweat from his brow and gets a better look at you. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ah, the Fatebinder of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]. I would be in a worse spot if it wasn't for those slaves you [url=lore:poison_well]sent our way[/url] during the conquest of [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ah, the Fatebinder. I would be sizing and adjusting a lot more around here, but I have less scouts to tend to [url=lore:poison_well]thanks to the Chorus that poisoned them."[/url] He sets his mouth into a thin line.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>100</ID>
      <DefaultText>He huffs. "You of all people know [url=lore:swords_fallen]how much our iron means to us."[/url] He slaps you on the shoulder. "A special discount on all my wares, just for you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shakes his head. "As if the Adjudicator would give me the time of day. He'd probably just point me back to the workbench and tell me to hammer more of these stubborn dents into place. They say honest work quiets a troubled mind."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They call the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] the iron legion for a reason. Strategy and skill may be our backbone, but our claws are made of iron - the good stuff that comes from the smiths in [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Forgive me if I don't share your enthusiasm, Verse. I am a tool for [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] to carry into battle, and I wear that distinction with pride. Do not bother to interpret me as anything else."</DefaultText>

      <ID>109</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I knew that [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] wouldn't have dispatched you without good reason. The Court isn't exactly known for gambling when the stakes are high."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>110</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And here all I got were some scrapes and bruises for my troubles. You holding out on me, Fatebinder?" She crosses her arms in mock reproach.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>111</ID>
      <DefaultText>He sighs and allows his shoulders to slump. "Thought not. I appreciate the update all the same, Fatebinder." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>112</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No... don't listen to the rantings of an overworked man. You were following the instincts of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s training, and knew no better. Far be it for me to set a soldier's expectations on your shoulders."</DefaultText>

      <ID>114</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I could have told you that was a bad idea. Oh wait, I did. And now your little ironclads don't have their iron." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's a rare smith who can churn out military-grade bronze consistently. More often than not, it comes out soft."

"Look around camp. We're garbing the legion head to toe in iron because it's cheaper and easier to produce for the masses. Couldn't do that with bronze." </DefaultText>

      <ID>117</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Would that Ashe and the legion gave me the opportunity! During our training at Fort Resolution, I demonstrated some skill with a craftsman's hammer. Now whenever there's arms or armor to be mended and no [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] in attendance, they look to me." He huffs and wipes a line of sweat from his brow. "Which is often." </DefaultText>

      <ID>119</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Not in the least. The [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] are artists who work in metal rather than paint.

      <DefaultText>"You're no stranger to that, are you, Fatebinder?" He spares you a subtle wink. "Iron isn't just a symbol of our strength and unity. It means friendship in some circles, [url=lore:lc_pick_of_the_armory]as you yourself have seen."[/url]</DefaultText>
