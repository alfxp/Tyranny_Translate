Behind her, the members of her gang posture with weapons held at the ready.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Did you not hear the news of the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]? This is a foolish distraction - we ought to be saving our fight for the enemy."

The Chorus warrior looks to his gang, giving them a quick nod.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No problem here, Lord Binder." She tosses her blade in the air, catching it with a smile on the way down. "Captain Fuckwit here seems he's about to balk from this challenge. Thinks just because he used to run a ship, he's qualified to run a gang."

She spits on the ground, looking up with a scowl. "So I'm calling him out - because the way I see it, his warriors ought to follow me, not this newblood."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Gang Leader spins her knife for a moment as if her answer balances on its edge.

      <DefaultText>You quickly snatch Quiet Shiv's dagger as she flicks it into the air. Before she can even utter her cry of surprise, you stab her in the jugular with her own blade. 

She crumbles to the ground, face twisted with as much shock and awe as everyone else's in the group around you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You turn to Shivershank and grab him by scruff of his scraggly beard. Keening with both shock and pain, he can barely fight back against the sheer force of your strength as you repeatedly punch his face until all that's left is a bloody mess.
