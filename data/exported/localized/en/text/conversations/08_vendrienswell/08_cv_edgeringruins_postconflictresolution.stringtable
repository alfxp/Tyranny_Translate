      <DefaultText>"[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] be praised! That oathbreaker fought with [url=lore:drastus_cairn]the rage of Cairn himself![/url]" Drastus slides a trembling hand along the cut on his neck. "Thank you Fatebinder, I thought today was my last."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Drastus' death will be a setback - he was a fine steward of this steadfast," Aurora swallows, her lips pursed in anger. "But with the losses we've sustained in this war, I'm the next in command. I will aspire to be half the leader Drastus was."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"From the look of it, guess they thought if they swarmed the pass, maybe one might make it out? We found a few scraps of parchment on the bodies." 

Drastus [url=lore:edgering_drastem_literacy]holds out a handful of crumpled parchments for your inspection[/url]. "A student of letters such as yourself should be able to make sense of this."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"One of the soldiers found some mage-blather on the oathbreakers." Aurora holds up a rolled sheaf of parchment. "I figured... you being trained in letters, could, perhaps..."

Aurora [url=lore:edgering_drastem_literacy]looks down at the papers, her face blushing, and quickly thrusts the sheaf toward you[/url].</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Repeating the same messages in different written scripts, the parchments explain the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url]'s desire to overthrow [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Archons, and rout their armies from the Tiers. The pages aren't addressed to any specific reader, but rather, openly invites 'all who remain loyal to the [url=glossary:younger realms]Younger Realms[/url]' to gather at [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url].</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The prisoner says his name's Tarkis Demos?" Drastus lets out a long sigh, tapping his gauntleted finger to his temple. "Then I don't think this is a complicated matter, he dies. His family's been a driving force in the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url]. Killing him should demoralize whatever's left of the Tarkis clan."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The prisoner is from the Tarkis clan? Then he's not just any oathbreaker, he's one of their leaders." Aurora signals to her men by dragging her hand across her neck. "No mercy for those who foment rebellion. Find a post and string him up... if his wounds don't kill him, thirst, starvation, and infection will do the rest."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But we must offer the enemy redemption!" The mage turns to you with a knowing smile. "When we first conquered this pass - and your fool Archon [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] killed half our scouts, [url=lore:edgering_chanter_react]the Fatebinder here knew the wisdom in letting the Chorus replenish their numbers,[/url] even if it meant acquiring some... undesirable talent."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes... well..." the Chanter narrows her eyes, scowling as she contemplates her words. "We are indeed guilty of being... haphazard in when we take pains to conscript, and when we focus on getting the job done."

"But the fact remains... this warrior has use - hopefully as fighting stock, maybe as swine feed - either way, killing him is the true waste."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The commander lets out a long sigh as he touches the wound by his neck. "These filthy hill people spat on the surrender!

      <DefaultText>"If anything, I say you owe us, Fatebinder! Last time you were here, [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] nearly destroyed this pass, taking all our potential conscripts in the process - and you refused to let us recruit anew from the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]."

      <DefaultText>"But we must offer the enemy redemption! Well, save for their inbred nobles - just ask the Queenslayer!" The Chanter lets out a hearty chuckle through an incomplete set of teeth.

The Overlord does not wish to rule over a ruined crater - we must conquer, but if we show no mercy, we will have conquered a mountainous stretch of nothing."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Let's hear what the Fatebinder has to say." The Blood Chanter turns to you with a wide smile. "My mates in the Blood Chanter Guild tell me [url=lore:plunder_parchment]you were most supportive of our claims to the scrolls of the Vellum Citadel...[/url] surely you understand that the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] is wise enough not to squander any advantage you can take from the enemy."</DefaultText>

The Chanter turns to you, an expectant smile creeping across her face. "So... what say you? What should become of this prisoner?"</DefaultText>
