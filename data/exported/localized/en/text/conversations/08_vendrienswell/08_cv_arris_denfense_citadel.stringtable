      <DefaultText>"We have set our reinforcements as you asked. I could use your assistance protecting the wall that runs along the side yard - that's where the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] are likely to try and breech our walls. I also need another good warrior by the main gate, where the rabble of the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] will try to enter."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces outnumber us, and they can afford to throw themselves straight at our gate - losses are irrelevant to the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url]."

Arri points to you. "We need you here, in the main courtyard, as part of the welcoming delegation. With luck, we can hold them here and stop them from entering the keep."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder, I need you to join the crew stationed by wall to the east. I don't have enough hands to cover this whole citadel, and if we're right, that's where the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] will try to strike."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Battle is upon us, the time for worrying is over." Addressing the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url], Arri ties off the straps of her gauntlets, flexing her fingers as she tightens the grip. "And now we fight as best we can until there's no fight left to give. Surrender means a slow death... or something worse - perhaps being Nerat's plaything. So long as you draw breath, keep swinging!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well maybe I want to keep a watchful eye on our newest ally. Besides, they must know about me now after Echocall, and I'm certain they'll single me out if they see me. I figure if I stand next to the traitor Fatebinder, the enemy might be paralyzed with indecision over whom to attack."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Unless the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] suddenly change their tune and help the Chorus, I imagine they'll target the eastern wall. While you hold down the courtyard, I'll have others watching the perimeter."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If I had a few extra shield bearers I'd argue with you, but you're right - perhaps it's better you fight alongside the Binder."

"Now I'm headed into the keep, hopefully the battle doesn't get that far." The Captain nods as she turns to leave, tapping her finger to her temple in salute. "Hear that? That's the sound of victory coming. Best of luck to you all!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh for fuck's sake! The Fatebinder's risking a lot to be here, back down. Eb, you're with me. Fatebinder, you don't need us to tell you how to fight - I'm sure you'll leave a trail of slaughter in your wake."

Captain Arri closes the meeting with a loud clap. The warriors of the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url] take their positions.</DefaultText>
