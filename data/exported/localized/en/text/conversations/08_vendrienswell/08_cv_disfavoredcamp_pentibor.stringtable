      <DefaultText>"Hail to you, guardian of the law." The man dressed in merchant finery greets you with a smile. "If you have a few excess rings weighing you down, best unburden yourself before battle."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hard work and good suppliers. When [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s men came to my village, all the merchants were given different lists of what they were or weren't permitted to trade."

He smiles, hand on hips. "In [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' wisdom, my record must have been a good one, because I was given the right to trade in all manner of goods - most importantly: arms. Not a lot of merchants can legally sell weapons - it was like that even before [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You know that if the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] suffer a merchant in their camp, that must be a man selling only the finest provisions and armaments."

He points to his collection of shields, rations, satchels, wineskins, and other sundries. "Take a look and see if something interests you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh did she? Guessing she didn't use the plural of the word armament," Pentibor grabs the token, nodding at its authenticity. "[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] smiles on you today, as I've a score of names on my list of soldiers waiting to swap out their rusted gear."

"I don't have a lot to spare. I can get you a sword, a helmet, and..." Pentibor's eyes trace you head to toe, then back again, "yeah, I think a corselet that just might fit you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Keep it oiled, dry if you must, but never let it get wet," Pentibor reaches out to hand you a blade wrapped in a leather scabbard, "got it? If I had ring for every soldier that ignored my warnings of rust... just be good with it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Sensible decision," Pentibor hefts a heavy iron grand helm, its surface cold and oiled. "Never leave camp without your helmet - that's what I hear the Iron Marshal always say."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Sure, just don't blame me if some Stone Shield wonders why you're wearing the armor he's been waiting for three span to receive."

Searching through his supplies, Pentibor finds a breastplate in your size and recuts the straps to fit your dimensions. "Keep it oiled regularly and it will serve you well."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It did, once," he answers with care, "but that was before I got the measure of your patron Archon. [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] speaks with fairness and wisdom. Unlike many of my countrymen, I was able to make this... this changing of the guard as comfortable as possible." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A little treachery can be profitable, merchant." Verse jostles his wares playfully, sending him scrambling to retrieve them. </DefaultText>

      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>He does his best to recover, unperturbed. "[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] is the right and proper authority of the realm, my lady. There's no treachery in that." In spite of his airs of confidence, he casts a worried glance out of the corner of his eye.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I try not to congratulate myself on my good fortune, since it's by the wisdom and mercy of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] that I make a profit. Perhaps we're not so different in that respect." He winks.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If I wasn't following the rearguard peddling my wares, my niece Rhona and I would no doubt be caretakers of a pitiful market stall, shouting above the rabble to make ourselves known to the lords and ladies of the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url]."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>He hesitates, and then corrects with a welcoming smile. "Of... of course. By all means, I have nothing to hide." He makes a show of removing a crate's lid and showing off his wares with an open palm.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm glad to hear it! There isn't a temptation in the world that would steer me from the good favor of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] or [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>You lean down to inspect the merchant's wares and spot a few rings that must have fallen to the bottom of a crate. As you shift supplies aside during the course of your inspection, you make a point of palming the rings, confident that they won't be missed.</DefaultText>

      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>His eyes go wide. "Peddlegrass? But this is absurd, I never touch the stuff! I..." He cuts off his speech and frowns. "Oh. I recognize this for what it is, though I admit I assumed things were more orderly in the military." He sighs.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I see that bureaucracy doesn't change with the flags we display." He sighs and counts out a fair sum of rings from the loop on his belt. "My contribution to the court for your generosity."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You won't find any contraband here. Of that I can assure you. And I've traveled in the company of the vaunted iron legion for enough of this conflict that my honesty can be vouchsafed and defended."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder... try to understand, my honesty is at stake here. Some merchants are willing to compromise much for rings or favors, but my trade depends on my reputation."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It would be simpler for me if these accusations didn't go all the way to [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s Court... but come what may, I'm prepared to defend myself in the eyes of the law."</DefaultText>
