"Just drop it. There are plenty of sticks around here. Isn't the menacingly-shaped stick the weapon of choice in the Chorus?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And just let you-" the Choirman's rage comes to a sudden halt as his attention turns to you. A look of recognition comes over his face, and he blinks up a storm, tripping over his words.

"I recognize this one... the Fatebinder, right? They said [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] was going to send one of the Court folk. Will you lend me a hand against this Northern pissbucket... no offense?" </DefaultText>

The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] warrior clutches his face and a long sigh can be heard from under his helmet. "Fatebinder, we're clearly at an impasse and I doubt he'll give me the satisfaction of striking first.

      <DefaultText>The warrior clears his throat before speaking in a measured, respectful tone. "Well, Lord Binder, I first encountered this man some weeks ago on patrol. He was part of a [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url] hunting party. He stood his ground... maybe even took a swing at me. I do remember thumping him pretty squarely on the forehead with my pommel. I thought to myself, 'nice falx,' and so I grabbed my trophy after the battle."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It was a rousing scuffle, but hardly worthy of an epic. I didn't even think much of it until yesterday, when this chap shows up asking for his falx back. I get that he's sore about losing his family blade, but that's what happens... when you raise your fist against [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], we don't give you back your thumb and fingers."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Anyway, I wake up next to some of my countrymen, and they put us through a decimation rite. I was lucky enough to grab one of the nine daggers tossed into the arena." He pauses to hold back a retch, his mouth twisting and the corners of his eyes twitching. "So I survive, right? And I'm barely cleaning the blood off me when I'm told my next task is to secure a proper weapon. The Chorus doesn't exactly hand them out."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So..." his tone falters, his face going pale. "I walked to the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] camp thinking they're supposed to be allies, and maybe can help. Then I see this guy showing off my falx and, well... it's a family heirloom.

      <DefaultText>"Eck!" The warrior wags a finger in disgust. "Just tell me you side with the mongrel, don't try to butter my ass before violating me with some excuse about how I'm in the wrong."

The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] warrior reaches over his shoulder and unstraps the long scabbard and falx. With a dismissive toss, the weapon clatters to the ground and the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] warrior walks away.</DefaultText>
