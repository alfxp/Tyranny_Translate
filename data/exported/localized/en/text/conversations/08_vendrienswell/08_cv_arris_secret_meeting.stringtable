      <DefaultText>Before you stands Captain Tarkis Arri, de facto leader of the dwindling [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url]. Short, sunburned, and agitated even when standing still, her body is a compact sculpture of muscle and bone, and her face is short on symmetry thanks to the scars and dents of a dozen brushes with death.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fall back, cover the Captain!" As you spring into action, the Tidecaster furiously signs an arcane sigil in the air. Dense fog rolls from the tip of her finger, rapidly billowing into a thick, concealing haze.

Muffled voices and the sound of hurried movement are heard from the guerrillas in the mist.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Excellent. Return to the camps, see what sort of chaos you can foment, and meet us back at the citadel. Not hard to miss," she points to the vertical line in the horizon, the Mountain Spire at the center of the valley, "just walk toward the giant obvious landmark."

"Until we meet again." The Captain nods to you, bowing slightly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"[url=lore:fall_apex]Peacebinder,[/url] thank you for accepting my summons." She points to a tattered swath of blue fabric hanging from her belt. "The one tailor amongst us was too busy mending armor, I apologize for the Tiers' most underwhelming blue flag."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So... remember how this was supposed to be a friendly chat?"

The familiar woman in blue nods to you with a smile. "Apologies, it was something of an ordeal to get Arri to agree to even speak with the Queenslayer. Earlier, she agreed to act like a grown adult but..." Eb shrugs with a beaming smile.</DefaultText>

If I'm to hold my nose and work with this assassin, I want my shred of solace. Be thankful I'm not having you gang raped by Chorus warriors or forced to haul gear for the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] like a common beast.

"But we never assumed we'd successfully carve our own free realm out of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' claim, we're brave, not stupid. No, we did this knowing we'd all perish, but in doing so, set an example that might catch on like wildfire."</DefaultText>

She shakes her head, turning pale as she does. "We were right to fear the Overlord. If [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' armies kill us, we die. If we kill [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' armies, we die. Charming dilemma we've been given."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well I would have phrased it as an alliance... 'capitulation' if it needs be but..." Turning red, the Captain shakes her head with a huff.
