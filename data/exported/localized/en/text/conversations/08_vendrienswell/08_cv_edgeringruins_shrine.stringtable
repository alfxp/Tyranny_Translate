      <DefaultText>The man whips a fist-sized stone into the air toward the weeping statue that looms high above. A second later, the rock chips harmlessly against the old earthworks.

"That loosened it up! If I find a larger rock, the next one will bring it down!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You're an idiot and I feel like I'm getting dumber watching you try this.  What we need is two gangs and plenty of rope - like we're dredging a ship out of low tide but we pull down, not up."

The hordesman nods at your presence. "Don't mind us, Fatebinder - just mucking about."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You must be from up north. This is a statue of Queen Lycaerus, Queen of Occon a few hundred years ago - guess she's famous for bringing peace to the Tiers or some such nonsense."

He shrugs with a smile. "Whatever peace she brought didn't last, so I figured the dumb wench doesn't deserve a statue." His eyes dart across the ground, hunting for another rock to throw.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Deserved or not, the locals revere Lycaerus and even maintain a little shrine to her. Since we don't have time to recarve the statue in [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' likeness, it is our duty to topple this blasphemous icon."

She looks over her shoulder at the massive statue. "Besides, I want to know if the water still flows if you knock off the head."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Not sure I like your tone, Fatebinder. You're right, trouble's brewing at [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url], but the two of us being there aren't going to swing the tide of battle."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The soldiers reels from the strike, bracing his cheek as he clenches his jaw from the pain.

When he regains his posture and composure, he opens his mouth and falls silent.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Understood, my lord." The soldier bows deeply, and then looks at her gang mate.

"That's enough out of you. Keep mouthing off and you'll get me killed."</DefaultText>

She looks at you with a nod. "We'll need their magic if we're going to topple this monstrosity. We can hold here and wait for some added hands. Thank you Fatebinder."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Look at the Fatebinder - lecturing us like we're bound by [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url]'s silly rules!"

He scoffs, shaking his head, "If you have complaints, you can take them up with [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url], or with my fists."</DefaultText>
