      <DefaultText>Pale and wide-eyed, the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] conscript takes slow, deep breaths as he shuffles with nervous energy.

As soon as your eyes meet his, he looks away in a panic, bowing his head and turning his body aside.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He opens his mouth in an attempt to speak but falls short. Glancing in either direction, he steps in close and lowers his voice.

"Captain! I'm-I'm not supposed to be here!" His voice comes out a harsh, ragged whisper.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I shouldn't be here!" His eyes widen as his voice rises to a near yell. "The Chorus... I don't know what I was thinking. I'm not like these people." He looks out at the camp. "I'm going to die here. Or at least, I hope I die here, and soon... and to think I..."

"Why the frig are you pestering my choirman, Fatebinder?" His tone is biting, impatient, and simultaneously dismissive. "Don't know if you can see, but I've got a game to win. And the boy has boots to clean."</DefaultText>

"Was an honest mistake, you know?"

He darts a glance toward his Chorus commander. His throat constricts as he nervously swallows a mix of bile and Vagrant's Chaw, and then he offers you a curt nod before hurriedly shuffling off. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He stares, dumbfounded for a moment by your act of kindness. Then with a small jolt, he lurches forward, nearly tripping over himself to accept the rings. 

"I'll buy them! I will, Captain."

The bronze rings clink as he clutches them tightly to his chest. He glances around to ensure no one saw them come into his possession, and a small, relieved smile flutters across his lips.

"T-thank you."</DefaultText>

"Best if I don't, Cap - ah, Master Fatebinder." He ducks his head shyly. "I don't think Two Tooth would like it none if he saw me training. And I've taken enough licks from him to last me the rest of my lifetime."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The trick is not to get hit, right, Captain?" He scratches a hand through his matted hair and grins warmly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With a scramble and a surprised yelp, he barely dodges the third of your blows - the first two knocking him backwards on his feet. Panting, he regains himself, avoiding your exaggerated and slowed strikes until he swells enough confidence to punch back.

It takes him a while, but eventually he lands a decently hard hit.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He cringes, tensing reflexively from the force of strike, but does better against the next one and the next, eventually avoiding most and managing to return a fist or a boot in the few times you allow for an opening.

He throws all of himself into the training, courage improving until he's left panting and exhausted and newly bruised, his thin, woolen shirt drenched to his back in sweat.

Eventually, he wipes the matted bangs from his eyes and offers you a grateful grin.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The trick is not to get hit, right, Captain?" He scratches a hand through his matted, sweaty hair and grins warmly. "Then, when the timings right, you've got to strike back - quick!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I won't forget my training, Master Fatebinder. I'll keep fighting and struggling, and I'll get stronger - till there isn't nobody who can push me around."

With a final nod, he totters stiffly away.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's been a real pleasure." He fists a grip in the back of Vittles's matted hair and forces him into a trembling bow. "We're honored you stopped by, Fatebinder. Aren't we, Vittles?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He grits his jaw, ired enough that he looks as if he'll rattle Vittles by his scrawny neck. But he merely flicks two fingers along the underside of his stubbled, scratchy chin and darts a nervous glance toward his Archon's war tent. 

"I get it. Children are sheltered by the Voices."

His throat constricts as he nervously swallows a mix of bile and Vagrant's Chaw.

"I'll look out for the kid, I swear. Won't any harm come to him, or it'll be my prick what gets chopped." He offers you a final, cold nod before shuffling back to his game of dice. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The gang-boss flicks his tongue over his teeth and spits a wad of blackish-brown Vagrant's Chaw on the ground.

"Course it won't."

He gives you a parting, cold nod and then drags the boy away by the scruff of his neck.</DefaultText>
