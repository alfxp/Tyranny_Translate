The [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] soldier nods at you, her brow furrowed in concentration.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I take it you're the gopher everyone's talking about. Are you getting the lay of the ruins, or just avoiding the Archons?" 

"We picked this area clean months ago. All that's left are some old stones, and that prize off in the distance." She nods to the towering Spire above the citadel.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's how I speak to you. Only just arrived in camp, and you think you know more about breaking a siege than the rest of us?" She huffs and shakes her head.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She backs off with a panicked look in her eyes. "Whoa there. I didn't mean nothing by it. Just testing to see if you had any spine. I can see you've got plenty." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This place used be an actual fort - when [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] came through, the Archon of Stone pulled down most of the masonry with him."

She spits an impressive glob of phlegm.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Not sure if it was intentional, but he left that old statue in one piece. It's carved in the likeness of old Queen Lycaerus."

She scratches the back of her head, smirking. "Strangest thing... the statue started crying blood around the time of the war. I like to think we clobbered the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url] so badly that their ancestors could feel it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I... I'll shape up. It's Fatebinder from now on. Didn't mean to step beyond my rank... sir." She frowns as if the word feels unnatural.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText>"I... I'll shape up. It's Fatebinder from now on. Didn't mean to step beyond my rank... ma'am." She frowns as if the word feels unnatural.</FemaleText>

      <DefaultText>"I know how to tell time by its shadow, and that it hurts my neck if I stare up at it for too long."

"Really it's no different from the Spires in the North. Big, ugly, and inaccessible. It's strange that the Vendrien people built their citadel around it, but there's no accounting for taste."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She reels from your blow, and looks up at you with blood trickling from the side of her mouth. 

"The Fatebinder shows his claws. Good. Maybe you can slap some sense into the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] as well. [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] knows they could use it." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Something in your tone causes the soldier to back down. "Have it your way. I submit... respectfully. If you need something, you have only to ask."</DefaultText>

      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ah!" She nurses her jaw and looks to Verse with a flash of anger, but it quickly subsides. She spits a glob of blood. "Forgive me, Verse. I spoke out of turn. Won't happen again."</DefaultText>
