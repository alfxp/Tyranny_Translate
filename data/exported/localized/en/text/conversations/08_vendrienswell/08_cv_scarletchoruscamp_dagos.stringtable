      <DefaultText>Upon noticing your approach, the merchant straightens his posture and smiles. "What an honor! The name's Sniggler Dagos. Originally from the relative tranquility of the Northern Empire, I've since accepted a nomadic life for the sake of keeping [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces supplied with only the finest goods - local and imported." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Upon noticing your approach, the merchant places his hands on his hips with a deep sigh. "Sniggler Dagos, at your service. [url=lore:swords_fallen]We offer no Disfavored iron for sale,[/url] I can promise you that. Ashe's iron-clad shitstains can salvage all the arms they want, while we fuck about with scraps of bent bronze."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A small smirk gradually forms. "I am also well aware of your past with [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url]. [url=lore:swords_fallen]We've benefited greatly after you ruled that we could keep the iron those Disfavored pups couldn't even hold onto."[/url] 

He looks around and motions to you to come closer "We may have stashed a bit more of what we found off the beaten path - Not all choirmen are as careful with their booty as others. Here, let me mark it on your map."</DefaultText>
