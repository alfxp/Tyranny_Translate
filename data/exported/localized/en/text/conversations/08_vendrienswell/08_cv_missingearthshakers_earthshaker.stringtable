      <DefaultText>"Ah, a Fatebinder. How fortuitous - " The Earthshaker pounds his chest in salute. " - for us, I mean. Decidedly not for the oathbreakers."

A smirk quirks the right side of his mouth as he surveys the carnage you have left behind. 

"Whether intended or not, we're indebted for your help."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Aye, the oathbreakers felled Grisandere before we could erect the barricade, but our circle alone was all Master Radix could feasibly spare. We're here, and though wayworn - we're ready to help."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"With all due respect, Fatebinder, it's not a matter I'd expect you to understand. We absolutely cannot abandon [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] to the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url]." 

His nostrils flare in mild ire. "As we've only recently located him and are in the process of constructing a fort to guard his remains, we could not spare another mage. Especially now, when the Beast tribe that flocked to [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] in his final days is becoming increasingly territorial and contentious."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And so Radix refused Ashe's orders?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"[url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] may be dying, but he's not yet lost. There lies the potential to harness an Archon's power in the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url]. And for that, I should think the possibilities are near limitless." 

He touches a grit-caked knuckle to his lips and clears his throat. "But we won't know unless we can run the proper research."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I-I'm not of a rank to make such sw-sweeping evaluations," the Earthshaker stumbles slightly over his words. "But I'd say he interpreted them in his own manner and to the best of his judgment - rather than outright refusing them. He is an [url=glossary:iron guard]Iron Guard[/url], after all. His decisions, though difficult-to-make as they may be, will certainly embolden our routing of the Tiers." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He chokes, and the Earthshakers behind him gather closer, murmuring in surprise amongst themselves. One of them, a woman with wispy, russet hair, slaps him on the back so hard, shockwaves tremble through you and into the mountains past.

"I-if they wh-what?!" He gasps for breath. "How?!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Overlord has issued an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Execution. If we don't take the Well by [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Day of Swords, everyone here will die, including Ashe."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, clearly Master Radix was unaware of the severity of the situation." He glances worriedly to the other mages in his circle as they all visibly absorb the meaning of 'everyone here' in the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]'s range of affliction.

"Had we known, assuredly the guild would have come in full force."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Regardless, it looks like you're all we've got. Report to Ceveus at the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] Camp. He'll have further orders for you there."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Earthshaker pales considerably. "I fully understand why you might suspect our intentions, but I can assure you, Master Radix and the entire guild remain steadfast to General Ashe and our most blessed Overlord. If only you could see it with your own eyes - our research efforts with [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] could very well hand victory to the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] in this war."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With a shaky nod and an even shakier salute, the Earthshaker gathers his circle, and cloistered together, murmuring or perhaps chanting in hushed voices, the battlemages march toward the valley.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With tremorous fingers, the Earthshaker pushes his hood back on a sweaty forehead. He glances once to the group of weary, battered mages behind him before meeting your eyes. 

"I'm afraid I'll have to do, as I am the mage in charge of this circle. Earthshaker Helspar, at your service."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What do you mean 'all he could spare'? Did Ashe not order your entire guild's return from Azure?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I beg your pardon, Fatebinder." He shifts on his feet, clearly uncomfortable. "By the time we heard the screams, you'd well splattered their blood on the rocks. It's a poor excuse, I know, but we're wearied from weeks of travel, and we'd already lost one of us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He spreads his dirt-streaked lips in a relieved grin. "May the stones guide your steps. And may you walk without falter on sturdy ground."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Or perhaps you would not have come at all? But you are here now, and you cannot escape the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]. So I suggest you report to Ceveus in the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] Camp and help us win this battle. Or you'll be as dead as rest of us."</DefaultText>
