      <DefaultText>"Glory to [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url]!" The Fifth Eye salutes you, his masked face glancing nervously in all directions, despite the rest of his body's otherwise confident posture. "The mustering song is nearly complete, soon comes the canticle of slaughter - and we will need the strong," he jabs a finger toward you, "to rise up and lead."

"By custom you are judge, jury, and executioner - today, we must ask you to take on the last and most sublime of your sacred duties."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The best bluff is often the most obvious." The Fifth Eye points a bloody finger toward the main gate of the citadel. "We charge for the gate - right into the oathbreaker's door step."

"The horde should bring the defenders surging to the inside of the gate. Then, we unleash our magic. Fire and panic will claim the oathbreakers - the more concentrated the defenders, the better!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url] will flail vigorously on their way out, but it will be for naught. In the dilemma between courage and overwhelming numbers, never wager on courage." The Fifth Eye gestures east. "We are more concerned by the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]'s presence. They are likely waiting for us to engage with the enemy, so that they might surround us while occupied. Given that the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] compels us forward, we have a rousing melee ahead of us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Our scouts report iron legionnaires moving in the area - it's obvious they have the same goal as we do, they are just a step ahead, it would seem. Make no mistake, the oathbreakers will be a minor inconvenience - the foul [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] will be the more worthy challenge. We must stay alert."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Our Blood Chanters are readying a conflagration that should take that gate off its hinges, but at the same time, the oathbreaker mages are warding the gate with protective magic."

He points to the northwest. "I need someone to scale the wall and kill the mages maintaining the ward. If I send these unwashed pukes, their corpses will clog the parapets, this task requires your strength."</DefaultText>
