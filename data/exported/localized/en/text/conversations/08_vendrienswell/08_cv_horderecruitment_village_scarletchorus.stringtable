      <DefaultText>Flicking the bronze tip of her blade, a Scarlet Fury strolls into view with a smug smile, flanked by an entourage of soldiers. 

"Not bad! I'd have piled up the same number of corpses in half the sword strokes but... well, where ARE my manners? One ought not to criticize help so generously given."

She sweeps her arms wide in an exaggerated, mocking bow. "You've my deepest and sincerest gratitude for gutting those Vendrien piss-ants in my place."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We already got what we needed - the willing ones." She points to several of the armed fighters at her side. 

"We were hoping a different face might convince the remainder to join us but alas... Well, can't win them all, can you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Whoa, now!" The Fury holds up a scarred hand in protest. "No need to break any bones over it. If you're frigging pissed, take it up with Death Knell. It was her plan, not mine."

She wets her chapped lips before continuing. "Look, then - I'll tell everyone how badly you slapped around the oathbreakers, okay? You did us a real favor, and you deserve to have your glory touted."

And with that, she nods curtly and sheaths her blade, bidding an end to the exchange.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Stow your bluster and take it up with Death Knell - because I'm quite certain that's who talked you into this."

She flicks her blade at you in dismissal - and a gesture that simultaneously manages to appear obscene.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Perhaps when you're older, you'll figure out that 'coward' is a just word people use to badger idiots into doing the dangerous work. By the by, well done on surviving this violent mess - how very... brave of you to even try."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She shrugs with a smirk. "These things happen. Look, you've done us a favor, and it was a real pleasure watching you fight. We'll clean up here."

The Fury nods, briskly, and for a short instance is sincere as she addresses you.

"I do thank you for the assist, Fatebinder."</DefaultText>
