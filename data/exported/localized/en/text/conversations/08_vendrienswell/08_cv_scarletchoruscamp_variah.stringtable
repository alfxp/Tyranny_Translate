      <DefaultText>"Please - someone! I wish to bow before [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url]! I thought all could find redemption in the Chorus!" A woman in the makeshift armor of the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url] lurches forward in agony. Her soiled, trembling legs suggest she has been forced to stand for days.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I heard the Chorus is looking for Captain Pelox Florian and his crew. I can lead you to them but only if you release me." She turns her head, taking a long look at skewered and smoldering corpses around her. She tugs at her restraints but to no avail.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A fine decision!" The Fifth Eye claps his bloodied gloves together, signaling two nearby guards with a nod. "The oathbreakers already had their chance to surrender and chose to play the possum's feint. Let's make an example of her."

      <DefaultText>Variah looks at the prisoners, once her allies, and closes her eyes as her bonds are untied. The onlookers snicker and cheer when a heavy rock is placed in her hand.

Mouthing something inaudible, she lifts the rock high above her head and smashes it down on the prisoner's skull - wincing back a scream as she hoists the stone over her head a second time to finish the job on the other prisoner. The bloody rock hits the ground and Variah slumps to her knees in defeat a moment later.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Good, good." Fifth Eye places his bloodied hand on the trembling woman's shoulder and nods to her. "Welcome to the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url]... do not fail us."

As a pair of soldiers come to lift Variah, the Fifth Eye turns to you, his voice filled with glee. "Where's a slave to clean up the offal when you need it?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This will end... amusingly, for the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url] would be smart to assume she only escaped by our whims."

"You there!" The Fifth Eye barks at a pair of guardsmen, beckoning them forward. "Release our newest recruit. She has orders to infiltrate the oathbreakers - see that she is escorted to the river's edge."</DefaultText>

Laughter erupts as Variah is dragged off to her fate.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Variah inhales deeply, flexing her fingers as she shakes off the stiffness of being tied to a post for days. "I will return to the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url], act well my part, and await further instructions from the Chorus."

With a nod, she follows her escorts out of the camp.

      <DefaultText>"I told this... thing..." the prisoner turns pale a moment, before a look of determination comes over her face, "that I wanted a guarantee I'd live and be welcomed into the Chorus as a captain - then I'll talk. Otherwise, they'll just kill me once I've opened up. I was dumb enough to join with the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url], but I'm not dumb enough to give away my bargaining bronze."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I suppose I have no answer for that." Variah's eyes fall to the ground and she swallows nervously. "When I joined with the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url], I accepted their broken vow unto myself. Have you not felt passion for a foolish cause... one you later came to regret? Well my surrender is sincere - and I'm willing to bow before [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] to prove it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Because I want to live and you don't need to be the Archon of Premonitions to know that the [url=glossary:younger realms]Younger Realms[/url] are gone for good."

      <DefaultText>"What?" Her face blanches and her arms reflexively stiffen, causing her to double back against the post to which she's bound.

"No! Please no! I heard nobody returns from his interrogations! I'll tell you but... but I..." she lets out a sigh. "I don't really know where they are... but I know to find them."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With a snap of his fingers, a pair of Choirmen yank the boot off the fallen Guardsman. A rolled parchment slides out of the boot and is thrust into the Fifth Eye's hands. He unfurls the scroll to give it a read.

"It's nonsense - just mash of words." Laughter erupts from under the mask. "She said she had information, she gives us garbage! Slay this wretch for wasting our time." He snaps his fingers at a nearby Scarlet Fury, who promptly snatches a long knife from her belt.</DefaultText>

The Scarlet Fury slices open Variah's neck. Pinned to her final resting post, the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url] soldier thrashes and flails for several long moments before bowing her head in death.</DefaultText>
