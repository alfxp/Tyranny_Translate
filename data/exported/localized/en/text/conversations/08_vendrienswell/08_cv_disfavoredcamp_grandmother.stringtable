      <DefaultText>"Don't just coddle the impact, push back with your shield, take the momentum!" Iron Marshal Erenyos, field commander of the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url], pounds her fist in the air as she calls out to the warriors on the training field. "I said eyes on your opponent's waistline! If you spend more than a glance checking his footwork, you've lost."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' ultimatum has the camp on edge - some with dread, but most are rife with anticipation." She points to the men sparring in the field. "We have a lot of brothers and sisters to avenge, and the warriors are eager to take out some aggression."

"I for one choose to see the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] as a blessing, for it forces the generals to act... and we're long overdue."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We can't just march from here to the Citadel with the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url] manning the riverbanks. Fording troops and supplies through even the narrowest points of the river makes us vulnerable to attack, especially since our armor wasn't built for swimming."

She points north, toward the Mountain Spire looming on the horizon. "If we can take the river, we have a clear march to the Citadel, and [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url] will be ours in no time."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Then our plan just might work." The Iron Marshal lifts her gauntlet close to her face, shifting her eyes from you to the metal articulations. "We are loath to work with those who do not share our training, and our values.

      <DefaultText>"Greetings, Binder. Here's hoping you've decided to lend your sword to the fight."

She scans the camp, muttering under her breath. "No matter how much I drill them, they never move with enough urgency." Her tone turns a deeper shade of sour. "And I cannot order them to rest for a day... not with the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] looming."</DefaultText>

She looks in either direction, surveying the movement of iron-clad warriors readying for battle.</DefaultText>

So while by tradition I am executor, or I suppose executrix of the legion, I hope never to act on that sacred duty."

"Make no mistake, [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] is the mind of the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url], I am but his right hand, a student to his military genius."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What's it... worth?" Erenyos takes a half-step back, placing her arms on her sides. "You read the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] - if we don't take [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url], it's your sorry hide too!

      <DefaultText>"We are better prepared than the Scarlet mob, that much is true, but the downside of being [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' most elite fighting force is that we only accept the best... which leaves us short-handed at times."

She cocks her head to the side. "I get it, your duty was to proclaim an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] - not to anchor a shield wall. If you assist us, I can put in a good word with Archon Ashe and the soldiers."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Defeat in detail. We carved a bloody path up to the river, but at that point, everyone who charged ahead was lost. We had no Chorus backup - it was just a few [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] squads. I can't tell you exactly how they were defeated, but we lost the whole assault team."

She shakes her head, letting out a long, pained sigh. "We found bodies washing up in the river for days. It's not often the Tiersmen put up such a good fight - it's certainly made us reevaluate the number we'll need to take this valley."</DefaultText>

"I have no right to give you orders but..." her words falter, a short cough breaking her flow, "but we all die to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] should we fail, so I'm not about to let my pride blind me to the value of good help."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Antio will be leading the charge at Echocall Crossing, assisting you will be Barik of the Stone Shields." She points to  a heavily armored soldier standing sentry at the edge of the training field. "Before you ask, no the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] weren't sloshed on dappleseed when they fitted his armor... he survived the full force of the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Storms and this armor doesn't exactly... come off. Tactically, it's quite brilliant but otherwise, it's something of a curse."

Tapping her helmet twice, Erenyos signals to the hulking presence. "Barik, come meet the Fatebinder."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Trying to pour salt on my pride? We left Fort Resolution with a hundred on hundred and there have been no reinforcements or reserves.

      <DefaultText>"I wasn't sure you would recognize me, Binder." 

A familiar voice emerges from the unfamiliar wall of walking iron. For a moment, you can recall the features of Barik of the Stone Shields when he wore the traditional [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] uniform during the Stalwart campaign, though he looks much changed.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Subtle. Shrewd." Erenyos shakes her head slowly, unhooking a string of copper rings from her belt hook. "Maybe the Chorus leaders have their britches sagging from too much wealth, but around here, soldiers are paid proper salaries and the quartermasters handle all the nonsense."

With an underhand toss, she lobs the rings your way. "If that's what it takes to stop the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] that threatens to kill us all, help yourself."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And you think I've something in your size just gathering rust somewhere? I've fewer men to arm than the Chorus, but the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] barely keep the legion fully armed and fitted."

She reaches into a pouch at her belt, pulling forth an etched wooden token. "Give this mark to any [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] quartermaster - I trust them to know what we can spare and what must be hoarded. But know that much of our incoming iron is already promised to soldiers who have waited years for repairs."</DefaultText>

Will we be stricken by plague and rot slowly - or maybe our blood will catch fire and we'll have a cheery little dance to honor our failure to the Overlord?"

She shakes her head with a snort. "I cannot compel you to follow orders. Maybe when you've come to your senses, you'll realize you've better things to do than sit idle until the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] kills us all."</DefaultText>
