      <DefaultText>"You there, and you," Signaling her warriors to the bridge, a woman in the regalia of a [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url] Captain pierces the commotion with her shrill soprano. "Get over here, the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] are back. Guess they forgot a javelin or two, be a doll would you - hurl them back?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Florian spoke of you. Said you might be different than the others. Sure hope he's right. We don't keep the Pelox boys around for their brains." Her face becomes stern, almost a scowl. "But he swore on his mother he and his crew were shown mercy. But now I see you with the enemy and..." her words trail into silence.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Wait, not another [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] - this is a Fatebinder." She looks you up and down. "Odd, I would have expected... well... just more soldiers. Here to convince us to kneel down and lose our heads?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I have a hard time believing such words. What is the mantra? '[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] does not wish to rule a wasteland?' The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] have stopped taking work slaves, don't pretend we aren't targeted for elimination."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Your friends seem to have misplaced most of their squad, guess they're somewhere in my river?" She shrugs sarcastically. "My family's been protecting this river for six generations, so it's easy to lose track of all the looters and vagrants we've had to feed to the eels."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Trying to take stock of our crew?" She lets out a loud snort, laughing to herself. "We've had unexpected help of late. Kill and rape a realm enough and everyone comes out of the woodwork to shiv you in the ear."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hold your oars a second, I have a statement prepared from Captain Arri for just this moment," She reaches into her belt and, with an impish smile, pulls her hand out to reveal nothing but the local hand gesture for penis. "Wait, there's a second missive here somewhere..." she feigns scouring her pockets once more before displaying her phallic gesture again.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This isn't just any of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' thugs!" She tilts her head, puzzlement sweeping her brow, "[url=lore:conq_armistice]We tell you we have a festival and you tell your soldiers to stay their blades.[/url] Queen Alanta tries to talk sense and [url=lore:fall_apex]you taunt her into a fight.

Not enough to kill us, [url=lore:conq_armistice]can't even give us one last holiday to feast, fuck, and be alive for a day[/url] before the Overlord washes us from history."

      <DefaultText>Her eyes widen as she slowly pieces together your face. "[url=lore:fall_apex]Peacebinder?[/url] This isn't another [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] warrior, it's the damn Peacebinder. [url=lore:conq_armistice]First the Armistice, then the surrender...[/url] here to rub our noses in all those agreements of yours we ruined with this uprising?"</DefaultText>
