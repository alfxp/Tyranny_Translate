      <DefaultText>The Honor Guard's armor is crusted with a fine coat of dirt and claw marks across her armor that suggest she has seen a few skirmishes with Beastmen. "Greetings, I am Anaxia, one among Tarkis Arri's scouts. I've been tasked with ensuring that minor disagreements between our new allies are met with an unbiased party's judgment." She eyes one of the deeper gashes on her right gauntlet. "Though... some prove to be more difficult than others - Which brings me to my request."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Last they were seen heading deep into Beastmen territory. I went with a handful of scouts, but only half of us made it back." 

She casts a worried glance over towards Hundred-Blood. "Somehow you brokered an alliance with these Beasts, perhaps you can reason with them?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her mouth droops open despite her best efforts to hide her astonishment. "You have a way with words, Fatebinder. With victories such as these, we may very well topple [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Anaxia's expression darkens. "I'll pen some missives of condolence to the School of Ink and Quill. A shame, but these Sages should have known better than to stroll into a Beastmen lair."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Anaxia's sudden burst of relief is suddenly met with the sight of Hundred-Blood from across the Hall beaming down at her. "Although we spared a few Sages lives, I can't imagine Hundred-Blood will be too pleased to know some of her tribe was slain in the process." She gulps. "I-I'll be sure to relay the news to her, let us hope she sympathizes with what's at stake."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Anaxia fidgets nervously in place. "Renata has been wary of this alliance since she stepped foot in [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url]. We can't afford to have her question our commitment to the Sages further."</DefaultText>
