      <DefaultText>"Where are my manners, I forgot to cast my incantation of crying like a coddled northgirl over a few dead soldiers." The Blood Chanter pounds his staff to the ground, his sunburnt face twisting into a harsh scowl. "I will not be lectured for a failure to show widow's weakness. Now where is that-" his vision snaps to you, "Fatebinder!"</DefaultText>

At least he's done the right thing to present himself here for a proper trial. I'd like to yank his teeth out, and I'd like it to be with your blessing... so I could sure use your judgment on this matter."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well our trail puts us between two [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url] patrols. Thinking they have us outnumbered, they draw bronze. We close ranks and fight together. It's a rather rousing melee and the oathbreakers give as good as they get - but among the dead - a dozen conscripts and two [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You dance around the important details, 'Chanter." The soldiers jabs a finger at Bitter Quip. "Right as the enemy spots us, YOU started working your mystic symbols.

      <DefaultText>"I don't talk the craft outside of the Guild but I can't defend myself with silence." The Blood Chanter clears his throat, measuring his words carefully.

"I invoked a spell of frenzy, and directed the chant at the enemy. They could move faster than our party and letting them escape would undermine the mission - so I fueled them with rage to get them to stand and fight."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There! He just came right out and admitted it! The oathbreakers usually can't fight their way out of burlap sack... but he grants them the gift of a stink badger's courage."

The warrior rests his head in his hand. "Madness, pure and simple. The Furies were dumbfounded and folded, and that's when Devona and Ceveus the Swift dove into the fray. Devona caught a javelin in the eye - just stupidly bad luck. As for Ceveus, after the battle he had been run through nineteen times - [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] couldn't save him."</DefaultText>
