      <DefaultText>"Well, look who we have here." Chewing on some manner of cud, a heavy-set soldier flings spittle and crumbs as she talks. "[url=lore:vw_heraldrole]The Fatebinder[/url] finally shows himself."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Regg and I were conscripted at the Gates of Judgment. He used to fight for Occon, me for Azure."

Baz chuckles, sketching her chin in thought. "How many fights we survive so far?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm Regg," the second soldier chimes in, "and this is Baz. We were wondering when you might pay the camp a visit. The Fifth Eye has been a little... starved for attention. He ordered us to-"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>13</ID>
      <DefaultText>"To watch you like a troublesome babe. Make sure you don't get out of line."

Baz knits her fingers together, joints crackling as she smiles.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Regg clears his throat loudly, scowling at Baz.

"Something like that. If you have questions, ask us - good luck finding anyone else in camp who'll give you answers, or even a smile."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Eleven?" Regg begins to count in series across his fingers. "No, fourteen. I count each day in Sunder separately."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Chorus is..." Baz looks about the camp and shrugs, "Not as bad as it smells. The strong, like me and Regg, we're allowed to take what we want - what we deserve. We live only as well as our strength affords us - as it should be."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Regg trades an uncomfortable glance with Baz and lowers his voice to a whisper. "They say he shares a direct link with [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url]. Guard your tongue around him. He's a little..." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Wild. Bloodthirsty. Mad." Baz thinks for a moment. "Brilliant." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>Regg flinches and glances over his shoulder. "I was going to say 'eccentric'. The Chorus isn't picky about who joins the ranks, so you can expect to find some unusual types. Most are as likely to kill you as promote you."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <DefaultText>Baz welcomes you with a grin of cracked teeth. "Welcome back, Fatebinder. We hear you've been doing some good work for the cause."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Baz spits a globule of something foul, which almost lands on your shoe. 

"Fatebinder." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Baz and Regg trade conversation in hectic whispers.

"Do you feel strange?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"High time that someone put the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] in their place. The Chorus could always use grit like yours." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The cause?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yeah..." Regg rubs his shoulder nervously. "Ever since the Fatebinder spoke [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url], I've felt like bugs were crawling under my skin."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>

      <DefaultText>They notice your approach with mixed expressions. 

"Oh. Didn't see you there, Fatebinder."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I was a sellsword at the beck and call of fat merchants. Just another dented face in the crowd. After too many years of spilling blood in local skirmishes, I realized that I was only killing time." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Then [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] showed me a better way. Unity. Purpose. Now I fight for something, not just someone." </DefaultText>

      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>He scratches the back of his head, at a loss for words. 

"I had a family. A farm. Then the Chorus came and... well, now I have the Chorus." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Priorities change when you hear screams in the night, and feel a blade pressed to your neck. Things like farms or families don't seem as important."</DefaultText>

      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>Baz spits a wad of chewed bread into her open palm. "These rations are foul. Taste it. Can't tell if it's poison or mold." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I heard that our watches spotted a [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] scout by the grain stores. You don't think..."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I feel fine. Maybe it's an herb to slow my hand in battle. Sabotage is a coward's weapon." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Maybe it's just gone bad."

Seeing you, Regg pockets his ration without taking a bite. "Fatebinder." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What do you know about [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url]?"</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The walls might seem imposing, but the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url] do a better job of hiding its weaknesses than fixing them." She shrugs. "We took the citadel once before, we can take it again." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We have to, don't we?" Regg looks up at the imposing tower of the Spire. "Though [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] knows I don't want to stay any longer than necessary."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>She follows his gaze and shakes her head. "You should know better than to parade your cowardice before the Fatebinder." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's not cowardice. It's just... superstition."</DefaultText>

      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Are you afraid of the Spire?"</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I... sorry, Fatebinder. I shouldn't have mentioned anything." 

He sighs. "The fact of the matter is we were told to stay away from Spires and Oldwalls ever since we were babes. Of all the dumb childhood lessons that fell by the wayside, that one stayed the same." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <DefaultText>"Imagine a soldier of the Chorus pissing himself over architecture." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"More like what's underneath it." Regg frowns. "The Bane lurk around those old sites, and kill anything they can catch unawares. I've no wish to meet the Bane in combat unless there are a hundred Blood Chanters at my back." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>She twists her lip into a frown as she considers this. "Me neither, I suppose."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Welcome back, Fatebinder."

Regg bids you a friendly salute.

"We hear you've been helping out around camp. I know the Fifth Eye appreciates it - as do the likes of us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder."

Regg raises his eyebrow.

"Whatever you need, I hope it's important."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder. I hope you're exercising your adjudication privileges on those [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]. [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] knows they need it. A little judgment would go a long way over there."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Regg, show me what the Fifth Eye has been teaching you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Been watchin' the Scarlet Furies, practicing my blade work. Not good enough to join 'em yet, but I bet I could show you a thing or two."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I used to have nightmares thinking about [url=lore:the_culling]the culling[/url]. Felt awful, remembering how I hacked my ma and dad to bits just so I could survive."</DefaultText>

      <ID>64</ID>
      <DefaultText>Regg's eyes, shadowed for a moment with sorrow, take on a feverish gleam.

"The Fifth Eye heard me howling one night. Pulled me out of the Horde and took an interest in me. Now I'm studying magic! Calling fire from nothing! If my ma and dad could see me now... they'd be so proud!"</DefaultText>
