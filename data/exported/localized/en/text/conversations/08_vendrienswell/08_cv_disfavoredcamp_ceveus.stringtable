      <DefaultText>"I'm afraid so. Radix, the head of the Earthshakers, was supposed to arrive with a group of his most competent spell-slingers to help break this stalemate. I don't know what's holding up their arrival, and that worries me. If you were at all inclined to lend a hand, we could use some arcane support on our side." </DefaultText>

Huffing with arms folded, the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] warrior bristles at your approach. He cranes his head to either side, cracking and popping the joints of his neck. "I'd ask if you've come to [url=lore:dcamp_ceveus]take over command once more,[/url] but having not been trusted with one since the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url], you can't rob what I don't have."</DefaultText>

"I'm Ceveus - er, Ceveus the Younger. We served in the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url] together. Good to be properly introduced. I remember you stopped the Chorus from turning their 'leadership selection' into one giant civil war.
