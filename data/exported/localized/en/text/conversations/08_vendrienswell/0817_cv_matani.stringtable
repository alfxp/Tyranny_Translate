      <DefaultText>"Really? The trail of my dead friends says otherwise. What is there to say, Fatebinder? Unless it's 'sorry for all the murders' followed by a big swig of hemlock, it's too late for words to solve anything."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Like the unity between the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] and the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url]?" She throws back her head, issuing a dramatic laugh. "That's not the sort of peace we want. Besides, peace is overrated, peace means tolerating the evil in your neighbor, it is a cowardly dream for those with simplistic notions of the world."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But I concede half your point!" A thought dawns across her face with a smile. "The [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url] was once simply the army of Apex, but now we have volunteers from all the realms joining our cause. So you are correct about bringing unity."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That is a commendable notion, but a tragically simple one at that. If any here could stomach life in the Chorus, or submission to a [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] work camp, that person already surrendered years back. The folks standing before you are the ones serious about our freedom."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Besides, we already reneged on a surrender - I know any deal you've come to offer is just a trap, as the Archons' pride demands that they bury us. So sorry, but we've been at this too long, death or glory - no third option."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So you can have a moving target to make it interesting?" She starts to laugh, the smirk faltering as your intent registers. "Wait, we can... by [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] codpiece, you mean it!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Then Florian was right," she nods a satisfied grin, "not all of the Archons' servants are anathema. I should be angry you proved Florian's point... can't wait to hear the end of THAT." She laughs to herself with a shake of her head.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Sure thought we'd have a fight on our hands," her hand moves toward her belt, "but it seems peace is on your mind. You meant it, you'd let us walk?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I thought [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' armies devoid of honor, I am content to be wrong on this matter as well." Captain Matani gestures for her crew to break formation and depart with one hand, as she pulls a parchment from her belt with the other, and pushes the scroll into your grip.

"Captain Arri had a hunch your mercy might not have been a fluke. She sends her regards and awaits your reply."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Good luck, Fatebinder." She nods with a smile, then leaps off the side of the building. The sound of frantic running quickly follows.</DefaultText>

      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>The Captain lurches forward, ready to yell, but stumbles over her words as your response sinks in. "Did you all hear the Fatebinder? Don't just stand here, run like the Scourge are chasing you! Guardsmen, stay behind - that moment you've been training for is about to come due."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I didn't know our guilt was a winter fever so easily shared throughout the village. But perhaps the only way to impress your Overlord is to slaughter the sick and unready?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That's about the logic I'd expect from one [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' pawns." The Captain points at you, hefting her blade to the ready. "I want this spineless pile of shit off my riverbank."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She holds her hand in the air while the last of the townsfolk flee. "A noble way to begin our finest moment... or maybe last stand? Either way..." The Captain lowers her hand, signaling the attack.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Far be it for me to question a call, but this village is a source of aid for the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url]. We would be fools to leave it standing to resupply our enemies the moment we turn our backs!" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Binder, what do you mean by this is dereliction of duty?! I could see us letting the sick and infirm go to tell of our infamy, but these southnobs took up arms against [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]. That cannot be forgotten."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fair point. I suppose half the fun in having enemies is fucking with their last shred of hope. Besides, it softens them for conscription." She nods. "A good call in the long run."</DefaultText>
