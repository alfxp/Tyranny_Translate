      <DefaultText>"Course, even if I was, it'd be damned near impossible to learn anything from this shit-sty. Fifth Eye and those damn Furies don't even loop me in enough for me to do my detail. And it's not for lack of trying on my part." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Isn't it? I know I fucked up to get here. Got three days in the hole and a nice little 'promotion' to go with my new post. Well, I won't be making the same mistake twice when it comes to the Iron Marshal."

He juts his chin toward the distant valley.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Won't say I'd rather take a lashing on the post to making conversation with a Fatebinder, but I also won't say it's not a tempting alternative."

He flexes his broad shoulders to work the stiffness out, heavy armor clanking as it shifts on his frame. Then he sighs strongly, as if the whole of Terratus has forsaken him.

"Forgive my insolence. It's been... a trying week."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But I'm pleased to meet you all the same. Now, what brings you to my little slice of personal damnation otherwise known as - " 

He spreads his thickly gloved hands wide.

      <DefaultText>He cants his head to one side, taken aback. "What about the Chorus isn't unusual? The army itself is a strange, malnourished Beast. But no... No, the screamers seem mostly in order, sir. And I haven't been spying - if that's what you're implying. Sir."

Still as a post, he studies you sharply, scarcely appearing to breathe.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"From the way most of my days go, you'd think I was here to row with Blood Chanters and Scarlet Furies. But my post is to represent the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]'s interests before Fifth Eye and the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url]' for Iron Marshal Erenyos. Not that I've gotten to do either in so much as the last span."</DefaultText>

      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"They're rabid dogs, the lot of them. Ever seen a screamer racing headlong into battle like a hound chasing a winter hare? I have, and I can tell you more often than not, it's the screamer who ends up skinned and gutted. Leave the campaign to the chaos that's the Chorus, and we're doomed."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No one tells me anything. They all lack honor and discipline. Don't think they could cooperate even if it's what they actually wanted."

He grunts. "Guess I shouldn't be surprised, considering they serve the Archon of Secrets."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"N-no. You must know, I meant no disrespect to the Overlord, sir." He shifts beneath the weight of his armor, uncomfortably. "Besides, only a dumbshit or a dying man would insult the Voices in his own camp. And I don't intent to be  neither."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hail, Fatebinder of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]." The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] officer pounds a heavy gauntlet against his chest in a stiff but warm greeting.

      <DefaultText>"I'm not just here to keep a steady eye on the oathbreakers - who they give far too much freedom after conscripting. I'm here to be a resource for the benefit of both armies. I can provide insight regarding proper stratagem and request a stock of troops from Iron Marshal Erenyos for reinforcements, if needed. But they won't listen to me, nor confide in me, nor fight beside the brethren I could request."</DefaultText>
