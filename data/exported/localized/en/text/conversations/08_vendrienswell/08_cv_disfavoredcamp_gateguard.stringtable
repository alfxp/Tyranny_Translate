      <DefaultText>"Oh right. You're the Fatebinder we're supposed to be expecting. Glad the Court cares enough to send its jester." The guard whistles to signal your arrival, and waves you through with a sigh.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No reason for you to remember me - I was two files over, one rank behind. The longbeards in the legion were so mad at having to, in their words, 'babysit [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s novice.' But you fought well... not as well as us, but certainly better than those dumb pukes in the Chorus."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You've arrived at last!" The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] warrior turns to the other guard. "This isn't just any Fatebinder, this is the Stormcaller! [Player Name] fought with us all the way back to the Gates of Judgment - served on the front lines, saw it with my own eyes."

The guard looks back at you, nodding slowly. "We're honored [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] sent you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's an honor to have you in camp, Fatebinder. Sorry in advance for all the arguments your presence will bring out. Hopefully it won't be like [url=lore:better_dead]back in Stalwart, with the Chorus trying to claim our work slaves[/url] just because they can't win a battle without crippling losses."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He squints at you with uncertainty. "I suppose the war looks different from [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s Court than it does in the front lines. No offense intended." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"None to you, maybe, but word of mouth and one's standing are important in the army. A cocky guard who doesn't know his business can do as much damage as a pitchfork to the guts. I thought you would have had that figured out by now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I..." He glances between you and Verse, then straightens and exhales a hard breath. "Wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of a Scarlet Fury, especially when she's got the Court on her side. My apologies, ma'am." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The soldier droops in defeat before Verse's intense stare. "Very well, ma'am. If you think it appropriate, I am a piece of shit. With your leave, can we move forward?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He looks at you both with incredulity. "What? The commander would kill me if I spilled an ally's blood... much less a Fatebinder's... much less in camp! Please, no!" He clasps his hands in a pleading gesture.</DefaultText>
