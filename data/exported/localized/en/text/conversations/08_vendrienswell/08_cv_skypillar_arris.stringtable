      <DefaultText>"So, you are the vanguard of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' conquest? Not as tall as I imagined, but we can't all choose our executioners. Already, word of our defiance spreads throughout the lands. You're seven kinds of stupid if you think our war ends here."

Before you stands Captain Tarkis Arri, de facto leader of the dwindling [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url]. Short, sunburned, and agitated even when standing still, her body is a compact sculpture of muscle and bone, and her face is short on symmetry thanks to the scars and dents of a dozen brushes with death.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Though your lives will certainly end here, here in [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url]." She chortles, pointing upward to the ceiling, its stone arches somehow supporting the massive weight of the Spire overhead.

"Consider yourself fortunate, some of the finest rulers of Apex met death by duel in this hallowed hall. Truly, there's no finer place to settle an intractable feud."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And what did taking [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url] cost you? How many [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] corpses rust in the valley? How many Choirmen fell to our blades? How goes the endless battle of the [url=glossary:blade grave]Blade Grave[/url] while you deal with us here?"

Arri laughs, wincing as she clutches her side. "And tell me, are the Archons unified in victory? Did the armies bond in camaraderie over our deaths? Our stand here is the first of your problems."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Nothing that we haven't already gained. Our pride, our dignity... these things you can never take from us." She smiles, her eyes distant for a moment. "The [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url] could never stand against all of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces, but we can teach others to resist, and maybe you'll run out of soldiers before we run out of stubbornness... but I doubt it."</DefaultText>

"Warriors of the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url], scions of Apex, children of the Tiers - let's repay [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' minions for the pain they've shown us."</DefaultText>

"I will die happy knowing your invasion will grind to a halt as the two Archons tear each other to pieces over the title of victor.

      <DefaultText>"Ditch the tough talk. Even if you had us outmatched, you know we can't turn back - not even if we wanted to... not with the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] looming over us. This here," the Iron Marshal points with her sword in a wide arc around the room, "is our hope. By the wording of the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url], taking [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url] will be our salvation."</DefaultText>

Before you stands Captain Tarkis Arri, de facto leader of the dwindling [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url].
