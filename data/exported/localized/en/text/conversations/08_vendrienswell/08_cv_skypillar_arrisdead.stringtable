      <DefaultText>White light fills the room, drowning out all details and pressing against your body with an almost searing touch. The force becomes an upward pull, and your body slowly sheds its weight - becoming buoyant, lifting off the ground.

Your feet leave the stone floor behind. Lifting up, you see only a white blur in all directions. What was once a sense of weightlessness becomes one of falling upward.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With those words of defeat, the burning hum you've heard in your head for days on end tapers off into nothing.

      <DefaultText>"Are we still under attack?!" Arri points to the floor, at several stones set into the ancient masonry. A bright light radiates from these stones, a light that floods all of [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url], drowning out all details in a blinding glare. "Brace yourselves!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Splendid!" The Fifth Eye slowly claps his hands together. "Wherever the Chorus sings the song of battle, victory seems to follow."

The Fifth Eye turns to the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url] scattered about the room. "Now we recruit the ones with fight in them, for we've the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] to deal wi-" The squeaky voice of the Fifth Eye falls silent as the room begins to fill with a bright incandescence.</DefaultText>

The [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url] are shattered, their-" the Iron Marshal falls silent as a gleaming light begins to fill the room.

      <DefaultText>In spite of her wounds, Arri is laughing - holding her guts together while a steady trickle of blood seeps between her fingers.

"You have doomed us, and handed the Tiers to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]. I hope you and all the other pillaging whores choke on your victory."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This is just as [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] warned... never," the Chorus commander pauses to cough, slightly lifting his mask to spit several teeth to the floor, "ever trust a servant of the law! Even if this is my end, know that the Chorus will make you regret this betrayal!"</DefaultText>
