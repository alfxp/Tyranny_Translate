      <DefaultText>"Human pack called [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] is vicious, cunning, feral - like tribes, like Beastwomen." She snarls, but the sound is pleased and rumbling, nearly a purr as she cranes her face in the direction of [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url]'s war tent. 

"Chorus humans are dirty and reek like rotten meat. So easily shriek and tear at own throats, but also respect strongest of pack. And Beastwomen are strongest of all creatures. Are best predators. Like Archon called Nerat - pack's fierce and ruthless Alpha. Is mystic who can swallow prey - blood and bones whole. Makes Beastwoman want to rut-fight-kill."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her nostrils perk as she rapidly scours her memory for your familiar scent. Then a sharp-toothed grin slowly spreads across her face.

"Human reeks of blood-mud-death. Of triumph and gnashing, wailing teeth. Beastwoman can smell - human is better fighter than runt called Night-Yowl."

She grinds the Beastman's face deeper into the dirt before lifting her clawed and gnarled fingers off of him. He quickly scrambles to his feet to nurse his head.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Human has keen eyes, yes? Can see Beastwoman is disciplining insolent packmate." She snaps a menacing sneer at the cowed Beastman. "Mewling, whimpering male. Night-Yowl will learn Beastman's rank in new pack - or will not survive for many seasons longer." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She puffs her dirty, hairy teats and purrs with pride. "Claws-at-Throat was born of tribe with no name and no lands, called Summer-Snout by Tiersmen who stole Azure-lands from tribe's ancestors. Then Claws-at-Throat became great [url=glossary:stonestalker]Stonestalker[/url], slaughtered own slavers and fought for tribes' freedom, tribe who became strong - unbreakable as stone - because of earth-mystic called Archon [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]."

She sniffs at the memory. "But now [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] sleeps and dreams, drifting slowly into death in Stone-lands. Hundred-Blood protects free tribe, and Claws-at-Throat fights to kill more Tiersmen as Scarlet Stalker."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A young Beastman stands in the shadow of an enormous Beastwoman whose stature still manages to loom over you, even in her crouched position. The Beastman's mouth froths with spittle that launches in every direction as he snarls at her.

"Night-Yowl was promised worthy, tough prey for joining! But Beastwoman only allows Night-Yowl to hunt weakest of humans. Saves best kills for self!" He pounds the earth, causing a small fissure to erupt. "Night-Yowl was second strongest of [url=glossary:stonestalker]Stonestalker[/url] males before joining Scarlet humans! Rutted even with Hundred-Blood - with tribe's [url=glossary:prima]Prima[/url]! Was promised own pack for abandoning tribemates!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The crouched Beastwoman lets out a deafening cackle - her broad, sharp teeth appearing between each bellow. 

"Strong [url=glossary:stonestalker]Stonestalker[/url]? Beastman worth rutting?" She snorts. "No. Claws-at-Throat sees only mewling first-season cub before Beastwoman now. Sees only tenderfoot. Only weak whelp fit to chase injured, dying prey, not best fighters on battlefield."

Night-Yowl bares his teeth and lunges for the Beastwoman, but she is swift to stand, hackles raised, and a calloused palm far larger than his head harshly pins him to the ground in one, deft swipe. His face smashes into the earth with a whip-like crack of stone followed by a defeated whimper.

Claws-at-Throat stares down at you with as much regard as she might show the wild dogs that roam the camp.

"Human."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her nostrils flare as she inhales deeply, scouring her memory for your familiar scent. Then she cants her head curiously to one side and her keen, amber eyes darken with a sudden and feral desire.

"Human smells of kith - of far northern tribe. Is strange. Human is hairless, blunt-clawed and male. But smells good. Smells better than Night-Yowl."

She grinds the Beastman's face deeper into the dirt before lifting her clawed and gnarled fingers off of him. He quickly scrambles to his feet to nurse his head.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Beastwoman snorts, a stab of incredulity opening the features of her face, then she howls with wracking, full-bodied laughter. 

"Claws-at-Throat likes human who is male - yet who is bold enough to challenge Beastwoman. Expected blunt-claw to be feeble as Night-Yowl, whimpering at Beastwoman's feet." She licks her fangs longingly as she assesses your hidden prowess and strength.

"If Beastwoman did not have runt-whelp-cur like Night-Yowl to train, Claws-at-Throat would happily enjoy fighting with human."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She sniffs in your direction, and her nose wrinkles as she scowls, disgusted by your foul scent. 

"Humans," she hacks. "Always are encroaching on Beastwoman. Have no sense of danger. No recognition for prowling, hungry predators. Are worse than sniveling Beastmen."

She grinds the Beastman's face deeper into the dirt before lifting her clawed and gnarled fingers off of him. He quickly scrambles to his feet to nurse his head.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Bare your teeth in a wild, dangerous grin.] "You smelled right. I was a member of the Bounding Viper tribe - raised as the [url=glossary:prima]Prima[/url]'s own brood."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Beastwoman perks up at your boast. She sniffs you curiously, more thoroughly than before, and she smacks her lips softly, longingly, beginning to slather and drool.

For a moment, you think she'll make a grab for you, but she merely sits back on her haunches, relaxed and watching you - pleasantly piqued as she scratches the taut stretch of her hard-muscled stomach.

"Would like to hunt with human from Bounding Viper tribe. Little blunt-claw will join Beastwoman in hot slaughter of humans - in one season soon, yes?"</DefaultText>

"Yes. Beastwomen like gifts of blood and bone - of fresh kills. But Claws-at-Throat does not want such treats now. Instead, little blunt-claw will join Beastwoman in hot slaughter of humans - in one season soon."

She spreads her massive maws in a deadly grin.</DefaultText>
