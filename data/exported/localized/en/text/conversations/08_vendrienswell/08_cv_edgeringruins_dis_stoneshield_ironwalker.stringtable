      <DefaultText>A broad-shouldered [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] soldier snaps to salute. "And thank [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] for that. There's been too much talk of late, and not enough action."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Archon of War is planning his next move. Would you have him hasten his plans for your impatience?"

The superior officer glowers through the gap in her helm.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"N-never, ma'am! [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] protects!" She holds her salute with a tightly-clenched fist. "I'm just eager to see the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url] buried under their own patched defenses." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's because the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] scoff at the Great General's plans, and they aren't carrying their weight. They should be using their great numbers to patrol and harass the enemy. If you ask me, I think they're intentionally going easy on the oathbreakers."

      <DefaultText>"Even if they listened to us, are they even capable of following orders? The [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] doesn't have a chain of command - just a rabble of gang bosses cutting each other's throats for advancement. Pissing on the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] is like a badge of honor."

"If... you don't mind my saying so."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If you want to put that in perspective, the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] are a sword - forged with care, then polished and sharpened to perfection."

She clears her throat. "The [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] are more of a rusty pitchfork dredged out of a swamp. Effective in large numbers, but easily outclassed." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"In my early days, I broke from my phalanx and ran at an enemy. Received a spear in my guts for my efforts. It took the better part of an afternoon for the Archon's protection to patch me up. Learned a valuable lesson, too."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder. A pleasure to have you join us. You never really know if one of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s officers is battle-ready until the fighting breaks out."

She nods with approval. "You can clearly hold your own in a fight."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"When I was at Azure, I caught a hammer blow to the side of the head. All I remember is a ringing sound, and feeling my skull shatter - from jawline, to ear, to top."

"I woke up hours later. The medic says there's a piece of helmet lodged in my brain." She draws herself up. "My badge, my reminder." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I believe in it all right - but I don't buy that he's doing anyone a favor."

"In war, death is a lesson. Survival is its own reward. If Ashe protects his soldiers, the weakest of them occupy a space in the phalanx that could be put to better use."</DefaultText>
