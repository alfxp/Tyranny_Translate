      <DefaultText>Sybil can barely summon the strength to crawl, and after several attempts, she slips on her own pooling blood. She lifts her head to focus on you. 

She mouths several words, though no cogent sound escapes her mouth, until she falls to her knees, bracing her side.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well done, Fatebinder! If this one survives its wounds, we even have a fresh present of the Archon of Secrets - he did request a personal audience with any leader we can take alive."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A wise choice, my good Fatebinder." Bitter Quip motions to his gang. "Take this one back to camp. And be gentle for a change, if you deliver a corpse to [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url], you can expect to share her fate."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I need two of you to scour the grounds for any of our own wounded," Antio gestures to his soldiers, "and two to gather kindling when we've got our own cleared from the site."

"Good hunting, Fatebinder." The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] commander offers you a vigorous salute. "[url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] protects."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well if we're going to solve this with fire," the Chanter lets out a long sigh as he slowly traces the sigil of a long-gone Archon of Fire with his index finger, "the least you could do is leave this to an expert. Have your warriors round up the wounded... if you want this town burned - so be it, we'll destroy all evidence we were ever here." The Chanter smiles a wicked grin.</DefaultText>

The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] warrior shakes his head in a huff, and turns to his squad. "Hear that? The Chorus just made this town their headache. Now start rounding up your gear, there's lots to do before we rest."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A sensible decision, dear Fatebinder. If we hold to the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]'s pogrom of razed soil, what will remain for us to rule?"

Bitter Quip claps his hands, raising his voice to address his gangs. "Seize this place! Search the homes, take all that you can carry! Give each survivor a chance at the Voices' mercy, but to the ungrateful, be brutal!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It would appear that Echocall Village had a larger enemy presence than we suspected. They also had a whole crop of iron weapons stockpiled here. Bet those 'innocent' villagers were helping to gather battlefield salvage, or maybe stealing from our camp?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And what of this village? The locals could have trapped the houses, so too risky to commandeer the site." He shrugs, his tone becoming matter-of-fact. "We should burn the town. It'll cut off support, send a message, and the smoke signal will give the others a visible rallying point when crossing the Matani."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Did we just waste all that blood and time capturing this place only to torch it all? Now I adore the mystical power of fire in ways none of you could possibly understand... but even I think there's a time and place for arson."

"Fatebinder, kindly tell Antio he's free to burn his half of the village, the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] would like to keep our half of the spoils, not smoke it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Really?" He lifts an eyebrow, at first with a scowl, then upon reflection, a smile. "While I would have liked to take her back as a prisoner, perhaps we will be better served by her returning to her nest. There, she will speak of what happened here, tearing away at what little hope remains."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Letting out a pained groan, the Blood Chanter shakes his head. "Ah yes, because there are so many corpses up here to choose from." He winks at you with a toothy smile. "Don't worry Binder, I'm VERY impressed by your valor and integrity."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A waste of life, if you ask me. You won't even entertain the idea of giving these villagers to the Chorus for conscription?
