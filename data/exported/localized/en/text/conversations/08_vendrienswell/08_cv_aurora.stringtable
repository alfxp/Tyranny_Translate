      <DefaultText>"Seven years..." she pauses to count on her fingers, "two seasons, mayhap a handful of days. I trained at Fort Resolution a bit before the conquest. Compared to the commanders you find around camp or stationed at Iron Hearth, that makes me one of the young bloods."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The oathbreakers hold the citadel at the heart of the valley - the one built around the base of the Spire." Aurora points east toward the tower in the distance. "The Matani river has been our largest headache during the siege. It's unsafe for armored troops to ford, save for at key locations, and the enemy knows this as well as we do." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They are the last gasp of the [url=glossary:younger realms]Younger Realms[/url]. Among them are warriors that escaped the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url] siege, a few refugees from other victories, and a bunch of Vendrien locals with delusions of independence." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I know we'd be a lot farther along if the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] used its alleged 'strength in numbers' to ford the river themselves and overwhelm the enemy." Aurora looks at Verse with a disapproving air. "As it is, we must take the valley slowly and advance the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] bulwark, since that's where the real work gets done."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Because all it takes is numbers to cross a river under a hail of arrows? If the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] were quicker to act, maybe the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url] wouldn't be so trained up to face us!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This has been a long and grueling campaign, but the end is in sight. We'll soon have the oathbreakers back under control. Then we can rest, retrain, and even cycle out troops so we can see our families again."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"These southern wastrels cannot match our iron, nor the Chorus' numbers. What on Terratus gave them the nerve to rise up and ask for a second helping of battle is anyone's guess." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I would have liked to see the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Stone hit [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]'s rebellious hide, but I'm more grateful that I didn't have to march against him. I'm sure you did whatever you could to stop that madman."</DefaultText>
