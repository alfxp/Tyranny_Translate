      <DefaultText>"I'll take that under advisement. Now, I'll just be leaving - no need to trouble you folks further." Surrounded by a quartet of [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] soldiers that have him physically boxed in, a [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] warrior clutches a [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] helmet.

      <DefaultText>"And if you think I stole this, YOU are sorely mistaken!" The warrior clutches the helmet close. "I claimed it off a filthy oathbreaker - HE stole it from you, and I liberated it from him. I bought this with strength - does that make your claim greater than mine? I think not!"

      <DefaultText>"TAKE IT!" With a flick of her wrist, the warrior flings an iron ring at the Choirman, pelting him square in the chest with the payment.
