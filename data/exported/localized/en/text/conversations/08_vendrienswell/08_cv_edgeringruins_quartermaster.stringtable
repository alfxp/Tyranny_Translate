      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder! What an honor to have one of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s Court visit our humble holdfast!"

"Need supplies?" Bursting with energy, the merchant slams her palm down on the top of crate. "If so, you've come to the right place."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, this is a service posting - no profit up here in the pass, that's Harchiand Bronze's orders. But when we march out of the valley, I'm back on my own schedule, and here's to hoping this year is a good one."

"The Overlord forbids the extortion of the pathways - good thing too, 'cause in years past, I'd lose most of my profits to tolls - couldn't turn a copper if I tried to haul long distance."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I uh, well you see Fatebinder," the merchant cranes her head to the side, scratching her neck. "I think so. I've been handed these bits of scripts," she reaches across a stack of provisions to snatch a scroll case, "but I'm not a woman of letters. Numbers are my strength, as you can well imagine."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A cursory read indicates this merchant is granted the unlimited right to trade in a logistical capacity. When not supporting an active battle, she has the right to trade grain, copper, and olives anywhere in the Tiers.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A joke?" Her body stiffens, her eyes dart about her wares. "I was assured... I mean, I paid for the rights! What do I do now?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A problem? But how can that be? I paid a span's profit for the stewardship. What sort of problem is there?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What? Maggot meal? I was told this was a logistical stewardship - that I could trade war goods!"

She grabs at her hair, body shaking with nervousness. "You aren't going to report me. I mean... if I knew I'd be swindled I'd... why, I'd be knee deep in that swindler's guts."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh, I see the problem." Her eyes narrow and her hand slides toward the strings of copper along her waist. "Let's skip some steps in this dance, shall we?"

She holds up a hand with a string of copper rings dangling from her fingers. "A donation to the court - call it a proper fine, call it tribute to our protection, just call off your game if you say yes."</DefaultText>

      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You what?!" A moment of shock blanches her face before a smile creeps over her. "For fuck's sake, I thought I was in serious trouble!"

She shakes her head, laughing to herself. "You've been around the Chorus too long - seems our sense of humor is rubbing off on your sense of justice."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That's the most honest extortion I've suffered all year." She drops the string of copper rings in your hand, clenching her fist the moment she lets go.

"Now if you don't mind, we're through." She waves her hand toward the gate. "Safe journey."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Thank you Fatebinder! I can't afford to be stripped of the right to offload my wares!" She grabs your hands, squeezing them both in her own, placing something in your grasp as she does.

"Consider this a small fraction of the cost of you've saved me."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What's it worth? Well... I guess it's worth all my wares minus one copper ring!" She cups her face in hands, scratching at her temple as she groans in frustration.

"I've got copper, an amethyst  - I think it's an amethyst, anyway - and an axe. A proper iron axe that used to belong to a [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]. His shield was faulty, not the axe."</DefaultText>

      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>She hoists out of her pocket a purple stone - not a proper amethyst, but a stone remarkably similar in appearance. "Maybe you've a lass or lad that'll enjoy a bauble? Though I imagine Fatebinders don't find time for children." She places the stone in your hand.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No sane person in this day and age does!" She reaches over to a weapon rack, pulling a fine specimen of iron craftsmanship from the collection of weapons.

"Doesn't bear any [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] Master's mark, but it'll serve you well."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Once done, you hand her the parchment, and she accepts with a smile.

"Thank you Fatebinder, you'll always have the friends' discount when you shop with me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well naturally," she winks, "Just because we fight dirty doesn't mean we trade dirty. Well, most of the time, at least."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Harchiand Bronze acquired these on my behalf - from Archon [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s agents, I believe." Her expression shows deep concern. "Do you see any issue?" </DefaultText>
