      <DefaultText>"The Binder of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] arrives!" Squealing with teenager's timbre, the Fifth Eye's voice makes your gums itch and your fingernails feel in need of at trim. "And we JUST finished having a bit of sport with some captives. But worry not, we'll have more fun with another batch momentarily."

Dressed in the bronze red regalia of the [url=glossary:crimson spears]Crimson Spears[/url], the Fifth Eye beckons you to stand close, wagging a blood-spattered glove.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Chorus is brave and fearless, but it lacks order, and if we lose discipline and tarry on our march, or falter in our siege, the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] will kill us before the oathbreakers...or the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] have the chance.

"An offer, Fatebinder. March with us? Add your strength to our tide of blades? The mob could learn from your example, and your prowess would certainly inspire."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We know the oathbreakers are focused in the citadel beneath the Mountain Spire, but we have learned this is not their only nest." The Fifth Eye wags a hand in the air with a high-pitched squeal of displeasure. "Given their pattern of attacks, they must have a second group maintaining camp here in the outer valley. And unless we deal with this second group, they'll attack from behind the moment we cross the river."</DefaultText>

"I could use your help questioning this Variah Kel - perhaps you will get less screams and tears and more useful information out of her. If we knew where to ambush the oathbreakers, we could try and take their Captain, and show him the wisdom of joining the Chorus."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Are you sure I can't interest you with pleasure slaves instead?" The Fifth Eyes taps his finger to his mask's chin, a high-pitch groan of contemplation emanating from under the mask.

"I agree with your conditions. I will share with you some Blood Chanter lore, but I will need time to prepare parchment - and such things will have to wait until the oathbreakers are silenced and we are no longer forced to act by this [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <ID>132</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Because a dishonest wage would be unbecoming of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s law dogs, no?" The Fifth Eye chuckles, his left hand sliding up his right sleeve. He draws forth a small ring purse and drops it in your hand.

"And while her humility is lacking, Verse is correct - she's been running with the Furies even longer than Death Knell. Too bad that skill and puissance did nothing to save her sisters."</DefaultText>
