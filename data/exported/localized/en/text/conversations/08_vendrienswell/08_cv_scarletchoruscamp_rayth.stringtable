      <DefaultText>"You?" As much an accusation as a question, the broad-shouldered woman shakes her head with a scowl. "So, you're [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s Fatebinder. I was expecting something more... impressive?"

She bows in spite of her misgivings. "Death Knell, Scarlet Fury. My time is yours for as long as it amuses me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The fighter effortlessly spins a bronze sword about in her hand.

"Let's get one thing clear - stick to your words and law, leave the fighting to the grown adults... your corpse would just be a tripping hazard to those of us having a proper bit of carnage-sport."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We are [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url]'s glory made manifest! In the Chorus, strength rises and the weak feed the soil!"

Death Knell smiles, standing tall as she extols the army. "Our ways terrify the cowardly and shock the naive, but our traditions exist to offer promise and prestige to those fit to claim it. We abandon all petty rules for one simple law: the strongest must lead."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Death Knell frowns, her eyes narrowing. "Do you not recognize a Scarlet Fury when you see one? We are the warrior spirit of the Chorus, scholars of sword and shiv."

She folds her arms, puffing out her chest.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"In peace, we train those tough enough to endure our lessons but wise enough to learn from the best. In battle, it is our duty to slay our foes and inspire the horde with our skill and bravery."

Death Knell clicks her tongue, looking aside to the others in the camp with an eye roll. "We are fearless vanguard of this confused but glorious rabble."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, well." The soldier looks you up and down with a mischievous grin. "I recognize the Fatebinder of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] when I see him. Not quite what I was expecting, but impressive nonetheless. Seems you're making a name for yourself in camp." 

She bows. "Death Knell, Scarlet Fury, at your service." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She points a long finger at you. "Know this before you let it get to your head - I only kill interesting foes - the ones on the battlefield who call themselves out with storied weapons or fancy standards. You might think twice before making yourself... stand out." 

She smirks. "You might just get the wrong kind of attention." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She draws herself up and studies you. "I suppose that depends on..." Then she stops herself and shakes her head. "Damn it, we have a siege to run here, and I have enough wounds to patch already. It's too soon." 

Her gaze levels with yours. "I retract my challenge... for now." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Let's see." Death Knell counts on her fingers, conducting some mental tally. "From your deeds during the conquest to how you've helped us since then..."</DefaultText>

      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I expected a worm - wriggling in feces and discharging a smell so awful that I would cut off my nose to forget it." She sniffs. "Seems I wasn't far off the mark." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>She shrugs. "Suppose I didn't expect much, and you've done nothing to challenge it. By [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] standards, you're no more ordinary than a conscript. Work a little harder on setting yourself apart. Maybe some day you'll live up to your name." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The soldier tongues the roof of her mouth as you pass, dislodging a stray piece of food. She focuses on you with open distaste. "You're the Fatebinder, aren't you? Strangers don't tend to mill about camp looking as useful as a carbuncle. Definitely not what I expected." 

She flashes the dim approximation of a salute. "Death Knell, Scarlet Fury." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'll mind whatever small authority you have, but stay out of my way and don't expect to make any friends around here."

The Fury effortlessly spins a bronze sword about in her hand.

"Not only are they more likely to slide a knife between your ribs, but chances are they aren't going to live beyond the next battle. All our Horde recruits seem good for, of late, is piling as tripping hazard to those of us having a proper bit of carnage-sport."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My... enthusiasm for the work brought me here. A decorated Scarlet Fury veteran, eh? But I'm looking for advancement. If it means killing one of the gang bosses, I'm not above taking a swing at someone bigger than me." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That weeping pustule!" Death Knell grinds her fist into her palm. "This siege has taken too long by far, and a woman has her appetites. Before you judge me, you should hear what that little creep does behind the tent flap..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The scenario she unfolds for you is horrifying in its design and scope. Part of you wishes that you could purge it from your imagination - a once-peaceful domain now haunted by unwelcome details.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We've got enough useless twats dying for our name as it is. All our Horde recruits seem good for, of late, is piling in a shit-reeking mound on the battlefield."

She hums low to herself and flips her sword side to side with several deft flicks of her wrist.

"Keeps up, and we'll have to toughen our recruitment standards - again."</DefaultText>

      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Swelling until it's thundering, then crashing and receding. It's been the way of the Chorus for as long as I've been in it."

She offers a one-shouldered shrug, ambivalent if anything, but more likely just uncaring. 

"We take our prisoners alive. Give them a chance yet to live - to be reborn into something better. Putting any and every able body to the sword like the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] do is nothing but a waste. A conquered enemy is but a new ally - it merely requires the proper... coercion."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A knifepoint has sufficed well enough in the past. But you've inspired me to try a more diplomatic approach this day. What do you say, Binder? You might be able to ease them into the idea - and save the lives of their friends and neighbors in the process."</DefaultText>

      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Of course, we do sometimes have the problem of lingering loyalties. Deserters are rarely successful in their escape, but they do try. The [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url], strengthened by their numerous blood ties, have been particularly stubborn. So I've a better plan hatched."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Fury howls a satisfied laugh and smacks you dead on the back. 

"My methods are sure-fire. You'll see. I'll mark the settlement on your map." She grins, biting her bottom lip bloodied. "I can't wait to see the outcome of your efforts."</DefaultText>

      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>The Fury scowls, instantly soured by your response. "Why am I not surprised? Impartial to the end, is it? OUR end, mind you, if we can't break the siege at [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url]. And for that we need bodies. Ones that aren't trying to desert during the damn attack." 

She spits a glob at your feet. "Tell you what, you change your mind about dying, you know where to find me."</DefaultText>

      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>The Fury doesn't even try to hide her glee, openly cackling and clutching at her belly. "You have my gratitude for rooting out the oathbreakers. Oh, come now, don't take it personal, Binder. I knew a fighter like you could hold your own against grim odds. Knew it the moment I laid eyes on you." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Plus, we've got enough useless twats dying for the Overlord's good cause as it is. All our Horde recruits seem good for is piling as a tripping hazard to those of us having a proper bit of carnage-sport."

The Fury effortlessly spins a bronze sword about in her hand.

"Either they need to learn to fight, or we need to toughen our recruitment standards - again."</DefaultText>

      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm thinking, we re-double our efforts to recruit settlers, focusing on the unaligned and unsuspecting, instead of flushing ourselves to the gills with oathbreakers, claimed from the battlefield."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>She flips her sword over end, in annoyance. If looks could cut, you'd be bleeding. 

"Oh, I'm getting there. Don't worry."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>She tips her head to you, a smile playing at her lips.

      <DefaultText>"You sure about that, Binder? You think long and hard -" 

She flips and deftly slashes the blade of her sword through the air. 

"- and you tell me if you're sure about that." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>She peals a surprised but pleased laugh at your threat. Tapping the flat of the blade against her thigh, she cants her neck until it audibly cracks. 

"Maybe there's something more to you Fatebinders, after all."</DefaultText>

      <ID>67</ID>
      <DefaultText>In one swift stride, you close the distance between the two of you and land a punch squarely in her stomach. The force of it knocks her back a pace, causing her to take a knee. 

She lets out a few coughs before regaining her composure and standing back up.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Scarlet Fury nurses her stomach and replies with a strain in her voice. "I'll make a note to watch my step around the Fatebinder of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]."

Just before she walks away she takes out one of her swords and gives it a once over before tossing it into your hands. "Good punch."</DefaultText>

      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>The Fury can't contain her glee and begins to laugh, but quickly winces at the pain it immediately causes. "Oh, come now, I knew a fighter like you could hold your own against those oathbreakers - knew it the moment I laid eyes on you."

She winces again as she slowly unsheathes her sword and hands it to you. "Clearly I've ruffled a few feathers, take this as my sign of no harm done, okay?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Scalet Fury notices your approach and takes a cautious step back. "Fatebinder."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>She bows deeply, gesturing broadly and overly dramatically. "I'll try to be more accomodating next time, Fatebinder."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>73</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You knowingly put a member of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s Court in danger. I assure you, this is no laughing matter."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>74</ID>
      <DefaultText>You can see the Fury's eyes from beneath her mask become tight slits that twitch with anger. "I'm reminded how humorless Fatebinders can be."

She sheathes and unsheathes her sword, playing with it out of habit. She shrugs, completely unconcerned tosses it in your hands. "Take it as a compliment."</DefaultText>

      <ID>77</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her arms shake with tremors of growing anger before subsiding almost immediately with a deep sigh. "If I've wronged the pride of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s Court as severely as it would seem, then take these as well." 

She tosses you a hefty bag from her side. "Some spoils I was hoping to hold onto, but take it as a sign of no harm done, okay?"</DefaultText>
