      <DefaultText>"Settle down son, I've been living here on my lonesome just fine. I've endured heat waves, breath fever, flooding - I'm not worried by children at play - just hope none of you kids drown in the river - that'd make your parents sad."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"See if I ca-" the old man pauses, mouth contorting into a frown.
