      <DefaultText>"Reinforcements? Finally! Come this way, we need to-" The Chorus warrior pumps his tattooed arm in salute. Midway through the gesture, a look of confusion dawns across his painted face.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh yeah? Come to steal my quarry?" He lets out a muffled chuckle through a half-set of teeth. "Who am I fooling? We met our match two days ago and aren't in any shape to tussle again. Much as I'd love the bragging rights of claiming some scalps, my gang needs a rest before we pick another fight."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I lost two of my gang in the mountains and we've been on half rations for days. So until we get a much larger contingent, we're not likely to win any fight we start. Now that you're here, I figure my gang will hold back and keep an eye out for trouble, maybe swoop in if things get messy."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes... ha ha." His wooden laughter is followed by a roll of his eyes. "If I'm to throw away the lives of my gang, it will be in pursuit of something far more grandiose and profitable."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Their camp is just yonder," he points to the northeast, "and we've kept an eye on them for the last couple days. Some of them left a few hours ago - looking for food, maybe out on patrol - but they haven't returned yet. Might be wise to strike now while they're divided."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My gang and I will lurk nearby. When you make your move, we'll descend and help with capturing Florian. Don't worry, I'll let the others know you did the heavy lifting. I'll cheat at battle, but not with my reputation."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Sister Verse? What did I do to deserve such a helping hand?" A chuckle escapes the man before he shudders, placing a hand over his mouth - at once alert of the need to remain quiet, his voice drops to a harsh whisper. "The Fifth Eye has a sense of humor sending you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yeah? And you said yes?" He smiles, holding back audible laughter. "Well thank [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] you did, because there's too many of the oathbreakers for me and my gang to take. My gang's tough, but we need to lick our wounds before we're seaworthy."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This one used to run with my pack... until he left for Death Knell's gang."

"Motherless swine didn't even have the guts to fight me for the right to leave - he just packed up and left with his coward's tail between his fat legs." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And wise move at that. How many have you lost under your command so far?" He holds up a hand, stifling a smile. "I misspoke. I'm sure you only got most of them killed - can't rule out death by their own incompetence!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Happy accident of a sorts." He points east toward the mountains. "We were up in the mountains with orders to keep the oathbreakers in, and keep any would-be-allies out of the valley."

"Strangest thing happens - tremors hit the pass. And the tremors lasted a bit, so I figured they were magical but there weren't no sign of Earthshakers or anybody!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh yeah? That'd explain it... we thought for a second [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] survived death and was back for vengeance."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Figuring we didn't need to watch the pass no longer, we headed downslope, back to camp."

He points with his eye to the north. "New fish in the gang's got good eyes, and she spotted the campfires from up on high. We got curious, swung this way, and that's pretty much how we got here."</DefaultText>

      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>His eyebrows rise up. "Not sure what you're playing at... and I don't like your tone. We had orders to watch the mountains east of here and found this spot on our trek back to camp. What can I say? I answer to the Archon of Secrets - I don't get told a lot details, but I sure see a lot of coincidences."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Seems Death Knell didn't take my advice and have you gelded to curb your outbursts."

Verse draws her blades in a fluid motion.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Of course you did, and I couldn't care less. Just know this - you're not good enough to do it to my face." 

She sniffs and glares at him. 

"Clean yourself up." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This one's not worth it. I have better grudges to settle."

      <DefaultText>With a swift, confident stride you advance on Fake Limp and grip his neck before he can step away. His stance wobbles as you clench down on his throat, and he presses his arms against you, desperate to push you away.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>At last he tears himself away from your grip, gasping for air and clutching at his throat. "I am sorry! Mistress Verse, I did not... I did not mean any disrespect." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ugh. Another time, then. Fake Limp, get comfortable with the idea of a knife in your belly. It'll come from me as likely as not."

Verse sniffs and returns her weapons to her belt.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Who the-?" The Chorus warrior blinks in surprise at the sight of Barik. "Don't recall inviting the legion to our little party!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And I don't recall needing your permission to fight the enemy on my terms, Chorus rat. You can boss your gang as you see fit, but to me you're just another scarlet-clad reprobate." </DefaultText>

      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>The sound of throat clearing echoes from under Barik's metal hide. By his total lack of movement, he might as well be a long-neglected decorative suit of armor. </DefaultText>

      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>The Chorus warrior takes a step back, instinctively shielding his face with his hands. "Slow down, not trying to start something. My gang and I are still limping for the last fight. You're Commander Barik, right? Apologies, seems I can't open my mouth without being rude."</DefaultText>

      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I can see that well enough. You're excused for now. We have enough on our hands with the enemy that I can't afford to squabble with every Chorus recruit we pass, can I?" Barik nods to you. </DefaultText>
