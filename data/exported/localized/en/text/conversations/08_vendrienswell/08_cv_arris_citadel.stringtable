      <DefaultText>"Agreed, we're about to have the Overlord's two armies crash down on us. This is going to be messy. Their lack of cohesion is our saving grace - we can hope they take their eye off the prize and turn on each other."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That is the finest news I've heard in ages. With any luck, they will turn on each other in battle... don't know about you, but I'd prefer the chaos of a three-way melee if the alternative is a united front of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' thugs."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"To an extent, yes. Almost two span back, we traded our [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] prisoners, as is our tradition, for what we thought was a truce from both armies. Fighting tapered but did not cease entirely... still we were happy for any let up in hostilities."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Sages have earned their keep by helping us mend the walls of this old joke of a fort." She points out to the citadel's masonry. "This place looked even worse before they started working their little signals."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We adopted a few of the stragglers that fled the [url=glossary:burning library]Burning Library[/url]. They're a shifty bunch but... given the circumstances, we're forced to trust," she stares at you for a long moment, "whatever we can get."</DefaultText>

      <ID>276</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We'd be overly optimistic to think we'll survive the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] - I'd say any plans beyond that are a bit premature."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That's not really an answer, but considering our odds of survival, future plans do seem wildly over-optimistic, even by our standards."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh get over your pride, Arri! If by some crazy chance we survive, our first order of business ought to be buying time to catch our breath and take stock of our losses! The time will come to loudly declare how threatening we are, but this siege will go on and on unless the Archons take their squabble elsewhere."</DefaultText>

      <ID>284</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That's true, the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] could not afford to focus too much on us lest they be overwhelmed... and the Chorus would want to link up with superior numbers before fighting more." Arri taps her chin, deep in thought. "You're right - if we survive the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url], we become strategically... less relevant... to either army."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Point taken. What the Fatebinder suggests," the warrior pauses, mashing her fists together in thought, "is probably the sort of thing we need to stay alive long term. Sure, we might fend them off in the battle to come but... they need to be disincentivised from trying to attack us again. It seems I should get over my pride and let the politics of the Archons shield us - if only for a bit."</DefaultText>
