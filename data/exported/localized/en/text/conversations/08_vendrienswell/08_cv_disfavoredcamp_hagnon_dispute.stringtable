      <DefaultText>"I still don't understand what I've done to offend! I respect that these are now [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] lands, and I'm happy to give the legion a proper toll, but she's going on about trading rights - what nonsense is that? I am not allowed to trade one thing for another? It's not like I'm selling weapons to angry peasants or anything of the sort."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What's there to discuss? We should kill this mongrel and..." the warrior pauses, placing her hand in front of her mouth.

"If the Fatebinder wishes to weigh in on the matter, courtesy demands we listen." The soldier clears her throat, looking at you expectantly. "This is a [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] matter but I know the agents of the Court do so love to throw their judgments around."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh well, naturally," Hagnon clears his throat, his face showing a flash of a scowl, "one good deed deserves another. Well when I have my shop up and running, I'll sell you provisions for a song and give you a proper bounty on any odd bits of weaponry you find.

      <DefaultText>"I don't know what you-" the merchant's look of shock subsides, his face becoming a sheepish calm.

"Guess I figured the average soldier didn't know his anise from his fennel." Hagnon shrugs. "Look - so what if I stole it from a battlefield... it's a victimless crime. The vultures would have just pecked around the equipment..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But I'm only here to peddle my wares - I mean no harm!" The merchant takes a step back, his eyes scanning the soldiers for signs of movement. "And if you think I'm a threat to the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] camp then... then you have seriously overestimated me! Please, how do I make this right?

      <DefaultText>"Well, you could rob me now and have my supplies today," the merchant grabs a flask from his cart, "or you can leave me alive and have fermented honey all year long.

It sickens me to make exceptions for this vulture, but if you'll supply the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] without profit, perhaps this indiscretion is for the best.
