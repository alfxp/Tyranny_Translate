      <DefaultText>"I am Lucia, this is Marcus," the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] soldier points to the armored man next to her, "and you must be... [url=lore:vw_heraldrole]the Fatebinder[/url]."

From under her helmet you hear an audible scoff. "We've been assigned to babys-"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Not sure there's much to tell you. I trained at Fort Resolution, this is my first campaign, and I'm proud to be with the legion."

"I... was wounded at the Gates of Judgment, but [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url]'s protection mended me good. I owe my life to him."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I do this," she unenthusiastically lifts up her heavy shield, "and I do this." She mockingly stabs at the air with her spear.

Lucia shrugs. "Playing host is not my strong suit."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"In spite of our name, the legion commands more honor than any military on the face of Terratus. Unlike the Chorus, there is tradition, discipline, teamwork, and unity of purpose."

Marcus looks out across the camp. "There aren't many of us, but it's better that way. We're a tightly-knit family bound together by trust and glory." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Are you bragging that you let your guard down and took a spear to the gut? You really shouldn't boast about a filthy Tiersman besting you in battle." Lucia rolls her eyes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Accurate enough," Lucia shrugs. "After seeing the disunity and bickering of the Younger Realm defenders, I feel lucky to be in the most agreeable legion of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' host. Even if we're not always the most efficient."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Assigned to your hospitality," Marcus quickly interjects, "while you remain on [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] ground."

"If you should need a place to rest, we can make the necessary preparations."</DefaultText>

      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>"... that you've been a real asset to the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] ever since you arrived. Not that anyone expected different." He beams at you with pride.</DefaultText>

      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"In all seriousness, I would take that spear again if it brought honor to the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]. [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] knows we could use it. We are the elite fighters of the Northern army, but somehow we still lack the Overlord's confidence." He shakes his head and sighs.</DefaultText>

      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ignore my sarcasm. I've seen the legion through my share of the campaign. After so much bloodshed, our pretenses of honor can wear me down." 

She turns a cautious eye your way. "The North is my home, and I consider each and every one of the ironclad bastards in this camp to be family. You won't find another army where each member of the phalanx is as beloved and cherished as the next." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Aye, and if you ever want some pointers on how to use that weapon of yours, just let me know." She winks.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText>"I'm handy in lots of ways, believe me." She winks. "Weapons though - aye, you could say I know what I'm doing." </FemaleText>

      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Relax, Marcus. There are plenty of camp slaves if I ever need to scratch an itch. Although..." Through the visors of her helm you notice Lucia's eyes roving up and down your body. "If you ever need someone to warm your bedroll, let me know. I sleep in my armor. Hope you don't mind."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Every battle is a reminder of the legion's superiority. The oathbreakers have plenty of heart, but nothing to beat our Northern values and [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url]'s love." 

"If you ever want to enjoy that feeling, I can spare you the time of day to cross iron." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Easy, Lucia. We don't punish curiosity here. No need to fly off the handle on the basis of a simple reflection."

"They train us well, Fatebinder. The Archon makes sure that our potential is realized before we reach battle, so most of us keep a cool head when we see any action." He looks at Lucia with a frown. "MOST of us, I said."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The story is common knowledge, but we don't discuss it here out of, well... it's not considered polite. It has to do with [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] and the rise of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' empire. I'm sure you can put some of the pieces together." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ashe and [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] weren't always on the best of terms, but all of that has changed. By rights we should have a name worthy of our vaunted reputation by now, but..." she shrugs. "Maybe someday, after my children's children have inherited my armor, we'll have a better title to call our own."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If you're referring to game, the Chorus hunted many of the animals to obscurity on the first wave of the conquest. Most of the meat we have to spare is salted and, perhaps more importantly, Northern. I don't trust Southerners to keep their livestock nourished." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The two soldiers trade a glance. "A question better suited to the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] camp, if you don't mind the smell. Anyone looking for a fight could find one among those braggarts."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I heard Iron Marshal say that [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s agents can intercede if there's a dispute. That sounds pretty authoritative to me. I'm not so proud that I won't strike a pose, if only to keep up appearances." </DefaultText>
