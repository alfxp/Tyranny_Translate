      <DefaultText>"How can we trust your rabble not to turn at this last moment? How many of your conscripts have family bonds to the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url]?

      <DefaultText>"Another brilliant idea! [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]'s cult is, we're sure, every bit as trustworthy and sane as the late Archon of Stone himself. You did notice the Spire at the center of the citadel... hard to miss it, being only the tallest thing on the horizon and such.  Certainly your earth-mages won't do anything stupid like... say... breaking the Spire's foundation. What could possibly go wrong?"
