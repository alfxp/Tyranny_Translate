      <DefaultText>"Glory to [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url]!" Projecting his salutation for all to hear, the grinning Blood Chanter raps his staff against the ground as you approach.

"Fatebinder [Player Name], I presume?" His smile quickly retreats, giving way to a sour scowl. "I am Bitter Quip, I am here as the emissary of the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He scoffs, looking away from you for a moment before sniffing and returning his attention to you.

"Reporting to the Ironhag is an insult. She fought one duel for her title? One? Her leadership must be continuously proven, earned, and defended... weakness should bleed to the bottom of the army - not rise to the top!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Chorus is the future of the Tiers, I feel only derision and pity for those who fear our inevitable ascension."

      <DefaultText>"My assignment here is also an insult, but one I will bear for the good of the Chorus." Bitter Quip sniffs the air, smiling with one side of his mouth.

"If only to see, with my own eyes, the failure of the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]. That will be a fine day."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He is supreme commander and public servant - He Who Sets Us Free But Directs All!" Bitter Quip smiles as he talks, his face turning flush.

"[url=glossary:the voices of nerat]The Voices of Nerat[/url] is the epitome of what each of us can be - a magician without equal, and the leader of uncountable numbers."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The doctrine of strength speaks to me, and I answered its call - as did some of my arcane peers."

"I took to the Chorus almost instantly. Unlike most, I cried not for the life of comfort lost to me. My magic invokes fear and terror, and I easily established my dominance over a pack in my early days in the Chorus."</DefaultText>
