      <DefaultText>"That's far enough, Fatebinder." A woman's voice booms from atop a nearby outcropping. Flashes of [url=lore:vwell_eb_intro]aquamarine body paint[/url] peak out from under her loose-fitting traveler's garb, and her outfit is festooned in braids and knots of sailor's line.

Flanked on either side by warriors dressed in [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url] regalia, the woman leans on an elaborate, bladed staff pulsing with arcane energy. [url=lore:blue_flag]A swath of blue fabric[/url] rests draped over her arm.</DefaultText>
