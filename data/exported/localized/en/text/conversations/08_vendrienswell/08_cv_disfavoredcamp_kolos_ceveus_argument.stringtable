      <DefaultText>"This will not stand! Such interference is unacceptable!"

As you approach, Bitter Quip turns to you. "Fatebinder! Hear my grievances! The [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] were on a mission crucial to defeating these wretched partisans, and the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] deliberately interfered and assisted the rebels!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Lies plain and simple!" Ceveus draws his blade and raises it toward Bitter Quip.
 

"You deliberately told us nothing of your plan to slaughter and seize that caravan! If we were on your home soil I'd challenge you and set this straight. Be thankful you can hide behind [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url]'s excessive hospitality for sleeping vipers."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] is not required to inform the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] of every action. [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] is coming - stop this nonsense and work together!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ceveus is in the right - the Chorus must communicate and coordinate. There will be no trial - this matter is settled and all of us will perish if you two can't work together before the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] comes to pass!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This is entirely the sort of internal conflict that slows all of us and benefits only the rebels. Stop this at once and focus on taking the citadel before [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' day of Swords.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ceveus sheathes his sword, turning away without making eye contact.

"Why do we even need enemies!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Are you Ashe's warm hole?" Bitter Quip winces, sneering as his staff begins to hum with an audible growl.

"Fine," spittle flies as he speaks, "I will inform the Fifth Eye of this treachery - you will not live long slinging crooked favors like this!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ceveus slowly returns his sword to its scabbard, pinching his face to restrain a smug smile.

"Matter settled, thank you for your understanding, Quip."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Agreed!" Ceveus slams his sword into his hilt as he hisses in reply. "Neither of us are going to enjoy it, but the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] demands we work as allies."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Unfortunately," Bitter Quip takes a step back, inhaling sharply as his staff ceases to glow, "I concur. This is settled... for now, Ceveus. But the next time there will be no words, only satisfaction."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Bitter Quip says nothing, but huffs and steams quietly until the anger appears to run its course - the ruddy glow of his staff dimming.

"Apology accepted, young lord Ceveus."</DefaultText>
