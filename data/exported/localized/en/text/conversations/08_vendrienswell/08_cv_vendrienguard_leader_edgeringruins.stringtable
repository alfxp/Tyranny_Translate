      <DefaultText>"Run down the oathbreakers - let none escape!" From the red mob of reinforcements from the south, a Blood Chanter emerges at the head of the rabble, the ornamental crest of her staff pulsing with crimson tones.

Signing sigils of magic and wordlessly moving her mouth, the Blood Chanter scribes a series of spells into the air. A red glow surrounds the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url] warriors as the Chanter's magic worms its way into their minds, blinding them with rage.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We knew that violating the surrender meant an end to what little mercy and goodwill [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces have or ever will show us. Now there's no turning back."
