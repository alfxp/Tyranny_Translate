      <DefaultText>"Stow your weapons or we find out how long a man screams before hitting the ravine down below."

      <DefaultText>"This blade?" With a jerk of the knife, he slices off a clump of Drastus' matted hair. "If you're so eager to see your ally dead, just step closer."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Tyrel dashes the blade across Drastus' throat. Blood gushes out from the commander's neck, drowning out his final words.

Tyrel points the bloody knife toward you. "Death to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]! Death to the Archons!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You? You're [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s envoy?" He watches you closely for a long moment until his posture slackens, and he lowers the knife. "If you will vouch for my safety, then I'll-" His sentence is halted by a spear thrust into his lung. Leaping forward the moment Tyrel lowers his blade, the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] soldiers slaughter the oathbreaker.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You? The Queenslayer?!" Pushing Drastus to the side, Pelox Tyrel bounds forward with murder in his eyes.

      <DefaultText>"Now that's unfair! I assure you, it's more a hunger for torture than a thirst. But you are correct - we have no charity left for those who have laughed at our mercy once before."

The Blood Chanter slams her staff on the ground, curling her fingers with a quivering hand. "If you fools won't deal with him, maybe I will."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This is how the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] behave under pressure? My dear Drastus, when you are done airing out the terror defecations from your armor, you should lecture your warriors on how to follow orders. Strange days indeed when I'm the responsible one in this fort."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The oathbreaker cracks a wide smile as you lower your weapon. "That's right - now the rest of you, drop those weapons!"

With his attention on the other warriors, you dash forward. He reaches out with his dagger to slay Drastus but your hand is already on his wrist. With a wrenching twist, you mangle his hand, dropping the dagger harmlessly to the ground.</DefaultText>
