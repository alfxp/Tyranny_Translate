      <DefaultText>"Yeah... no sooner does he leave one prison that he gets shoved into another. I see your point, but I don't share your optimism. I only hope he manages to stay... human, in there."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Barik and I were siblings by blood, but damn it... it's not like we grew up together. He had no reason to take my place. That big, dumb, iron shit tower. What did he feel that I don't understand?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Just... stay out of my business, Fatebinder. He's gone, but so is the Voices. I'm sure Barik would be happy about that much. As if I knew him at all. As if we even had the time to get to know each other."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There was a time when this war was too small for us both, and we butted heads constantly. I wanted him out of my life. I wished that he didn't even exist. Now that he's gone, I just want him back."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I do. He's not at his former strength, but he's in there. I'm sure the others are keeping him subdued... somehow. In that chaotic, howling sea of memory, I hope he never reaches shore." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If we're being honest with each other, I have my doubts. The Voices could scheme a thousand steps ahead of anyone - I can only imagine that he had something planned for his death, some contingency."</DefaultText>
