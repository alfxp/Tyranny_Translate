      <DefaultText>A young woman stands here, surrounded by a group of villagers. She speaks to them in soft, dulcet tones, holding them hypnotized with her hand motions. She wears an ornate headdress that surrounds her face, its forehead inset with an enormous red gem. The headdress flashes as she speaks and you are unable to tell if it's a trick of the light or the gem in it is actually glowing. She is swept up in her oration and seems completely unaware you've arrived. It takes a few moments before you realize she was also in the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] camp in [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url].
