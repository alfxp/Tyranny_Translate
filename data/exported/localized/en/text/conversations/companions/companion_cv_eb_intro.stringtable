      <DefaultText>"Most of us never assumed we'd live for more than a few days, let alone a few span.

      <DefaultText>"Like many in the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url], I had a perfectly lovely life up until a few years back, when war came and swept it all away. The Tidecasters fell apart when our leader and founder, Occulted Jade, Archon of Tides chose to flee the Tiers... leaving only the most irritable, the most ornery, and the most ample-bosomed Tidecasters behind to make a stand."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Of course, our little stand was a disaster.

"So the cause seemed just hopeless enough to suit my fancy. And really, I had a choice between being an old slave or a young-ish corpse. I suppose all life choices come down to a question of risk or rest."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Of a sorts, you are the Peacebinder, after all. I've no idea if you imagine yourself to be a good person, a monster, or some mix of the two.

      <DefaultText>"Not initially. One of the warriors in the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] was leaking us information and spread word you'd be coming to the valley with an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] to proclaim. In truth, I was sent to try and kill you, to maybe stop the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]. But the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] was already enacted by the time I found you - so at that point, talking seemed far more prudent than fighting."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The notion to try and recruit someone from [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] army came a bit later, as we were pondering the death sentence of the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url].

But Florian was convinced you were the answer. He said you were sincere in your desire to survive the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] with as little loss of life as possible.
