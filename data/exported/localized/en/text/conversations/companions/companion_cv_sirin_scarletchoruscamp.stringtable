      <DefaultText>A young woman stands flanked by a pair of soldiers. The ornate headdress cresting her brow lends her otherwise small figure an intimidating aspect. From gear to gown, everything about her starkly contrasts the wretched state of the camp.

She looks both at ease and uncomfortable - composed in her element and completely unsure.

She turns to you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Greetings, worm."

Her voice takes you off your guard. It is bare of any inflection, and yet full of beautiful music. If you didn't know better, you would guess that she is actively suppressing or modulating her vocal tone.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You don't know me, little worm? I am Sirin, and my degenerate allies have the pleasure of calling me the Archon of Song." You hear the distant peal of a bell in her laugh. She regards you for a moment with dim interest.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Sirin's mouth opens in a perfect O-shape, and the sound that pours out is captivating, entrancing. It dampens the ambient bustle of the camp, until it seems that nothing exists but her voice. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Really? That's it? How disappointing. It was worth a try, I suppose. Though it appears to have been a colossal waste of effort." She sighs and gives a sheepish smile.</DefaultText>

      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I said dismissed until I have further need of you! Your presence displeases me!" 

This time her voice takes on a different quality - it screeches like a piece of flint stuck in a grinding wheel. You can feel it down to your toes, and you want nothing more than to make a hasty exit before the Archon inflicts more of her terrifying song. </DefaultText>

      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>You discover that Sirin's helmet is locked behind her head with a complicated mechanism. You want nothing more than to bash the lock apart and free the Archon, satisfying her command.</DefaultText>

      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>Before you can make the attempt, one of Sirin's guards places her hand on yours and shakes her head. She points to a wad of cotton sticking in her ear. 

The distraction shakes you from your stupor. You feel dizzy and sniff back a trickle of blood from your nose. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Do you remember me, Fatebinder? Now, don't disappoint me. [url=lore:lc_sirin_followers]You used my flock as chaff for the Scarlet Chorus.[/url] You took my people - the followers of Sirin, the Archon of Song." The gentle breeze of her words gains force as her eyes harden ever-so-slightly.

She takes a small step forward and the soldiers to her side move in, barring passage with their weapons. She looks at them and rolls her eyes. When she does, the sound of the approaching storm fades.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Have you already forgotten me, Fatebinder? Do you remember? You [url=lore:lc_sirin_followers]let the Disfavored kill my followers[/url] - the flock of Sirin, the Archon of Song." Her voice drips with an acid you feel at the back of your mind. Her eyes harden.

She moves forward and the soldiers to her side move in, barring passage with their weapons. She looks at them and then pushes the swords apart with a finger. When she does, the burning pain in your head ceases.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh, look. 'Father' has returned. Have I gotten out of line? Have you come to punish me? Am I a bad girl? Or do you just want to use my power?" 

Her face takes on a mock-serious demeanor as she speaks and with her words you hear the sound of a breeze rustling through the forest. It's at the same time calming and distressing. The girl smiles.</DefaultText>

      <ID>67</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You address me, lady? Finer craftsmanship I have never seen. You wish the helmet... removed?" 

Barik hesitates before Sirin. He seems at once ready to follow her order and nervously uncertain.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your words hit Barik like a battering ram. He sways on the spot, reeling from the impact. A moment later he focuses away from the Archon and back to you. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes, Fatebinder. I am the Archon's instrument - the devoted envoy of her beautiful song."

      <DefaultText>Barik fumbles with the complex locking mechanism that fastens the helmet shut. Perplexed, he gives up and begins to pull at his own helmet, struggling to pry away at the metal fused to his shoulders and neck. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As she speaks, your vision clouds and you feel the air grow still. All nearby conversations stop and an electric silence surrounds you.

      <DefaultText>"Do you remember me, Fatebinder? Now, don't disappoint me. We worked together at the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url]. [url=lore:bl_sirin_song]You used my voice to subdue those naughty Sages who tried to escape your edict.[/url]" The gentle breeze of her words gains force as she speaks.

She takes a small step forward and the soldiers to her side move in, barring passage with their weapons. She looks at them and rolls her eyes. When she does, the sound of the approaching storm fades.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] are very close with one another. If one is lost, it's practically like losing a family member! Can you imagine how Ashe feels after losing a handful of his men?" She trails off and stands in thought for a few moments.</DefaultText>
