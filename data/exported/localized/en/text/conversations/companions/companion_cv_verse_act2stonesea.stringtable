      <DefaultText>"You again? I expected to find you heaped in a mass grave or stripped and hung on a battle standard - not getting in my way." Verse frowns as you approach.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You again? Either this realm is too small or the army is, because you keep turning up like a dented ring." </DefaultText>

      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Nothing that has to do with you or your dumb mission. When you kicked me to the curb at [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url], suddenly [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] wanted nothing to do with me. I was just a convenient spy to him." She gives you a petulant look.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Don't make it sound so romantic, you courtly pig. And the answer is no. I'm building a gang here in the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url], and I don't need you or your problems mucking up my business." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"See, that's where we have a problem. You're on the wrong side of this war, and I can have [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] eating out of my palm this time tomorrow if I bring him your severed head." She twirls her weapon and regards you with hunger.</DefaultText>

      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>"After everything that happened in [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url], now you come crawling back to me? What part of 'I want to fight you' don't you understand? You're here to wipe out my new gang, and I can't have that." Verse looks at you dumbfounded.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Wasting no further words on you, Verse lunges with her weapon drawn.</DefaultText>

      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Verse. Gangs come and go, but like it or not the Fatebinder got this war in motion. Do we really want to have this squabble now, when there's work to be done out there?" He makes a broad, sweeping gesture around.</DefaultText>

      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You're an ass, you know that? Fine. Fine! I'm willing to put [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url] behind us if we can put a dent in this war already, because even I'm looking forward to settling down some day. Let's go." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Because I said we do. You're here to fuck with a Chorus operation, and I see an opportunity for advancement. Is it really so difficult to figure this one out? No one will mourn over the death of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s louse." </DefaultText>

      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>At first it looks like Verse is going to rush you with bloodthirsty intensity. The last second before you two collide in combat, she dances back a ways and regards you with a mixed expression.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"If you'll have me, I'll leave the operation here and lend you my blade. I can't promise that we'll be fast friends or any sentimental bullshit like that, but there's nothing saying we have to kill each other here and now."</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I figure I can do better work for the Chorus alive than dead anyway. [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]The Voices of Nerat[/url] won't take it too personally if I stick by you for a while. Let's be off." She gestures ahead.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The new recruits are plenty green, and could use some discipline. It would take a couple of battles to whip them into shape, but if you think about the time..." Verse strokes her chin and sighs, shaking her head.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No... no, he can't. Even doing his bidding just grabs his attention and makes you a target for [url=lore:voices_power]some terrible fate.[/url] I've always tried to toe that line without going too far in one direction or another."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I... damn it! I know I'm an idiot for saying this, but... I'm wrong. You could still be the best thing for this war. You caught the attention of the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] in the past, and that has to count for something." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Soldier! I've been called a lot of names in my day, but that is a new one. I hope that wasn't meant to flatter me into joining your little cohort there, because I'm building up my own little gang, and you'd only take up space in my busy day."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>[Playful] "So don't join my gang. Can I join yours?" </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>Verse's eyes widen, but she quickly glances away to hide her interest as she weighs her options. She turns back to you and clears her throat.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I don't make a habit of conscripting from [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s Court, but this is war and every blade is needed for the cause."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Very well. You can call yourself a member of my crew. Since you've seen more combat than most new recruits, I'll even let you call some of the shots, though don't expect me to stay quiet if I hear you fucking up. Is that understood?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That's what I like to hear! As you were, then, maggot." Verse claps her hands and gestures for you to keep moving.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>61</ID>
      <DefaultText>You swing at Verse, but she catches the blow and grimaces at you with her teeth clenched in fury.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>62</ID>
      <DefaultText>Verse grimaces as she listens to him speak, growing more disgusted by the second as she looks him up and down, shaking her head.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You smell like shit. Can you even tell, or are you too dense under that metal hide?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Did I even hear you correctly? After what went down in [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url], you come to me with this shit? The answer's no. In fact, the answer is 'I'm going to kill you, because [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] wants your skin.' Does that help?" She draws a weapon and advances slowly.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <DefaultText>"I could have been his personal guard at Cacophony - a Crimson Spear by now, even - but instead he sent me here to keep the locals in line. As if I recruited because of my people skills." She snorts.</DefaultText>
