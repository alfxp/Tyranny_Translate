      <DefaultText>Hands gripping her hairy shoulders to steady yourself, you ram your forehead as hard as you can into her swarthy snout.

Bone crunches audibly and Kills-in-Shadow howls, rearing back as blood spates down the front of her chin and throat.

She gnashes her red-tinged fangs, pained and furious and looking for a moment as if she may very well tear your throat out. But then she licks the blood coating her lips and grins at you dangerously.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Alpha has given Kills-in-Shadow new scar," she remarks with equal parts awe and excitement. She tears the weapon from her side and tosses it to the ground, the exposed wound raw and weeping. 

"Is good scar. Cut deep. Even now aches."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You've heard the tales before, that Beastwomen do not grieve, that such heartless monsters shed no tears, not even for their own cubs that have died. You may have even believed them in a time past. But there's no mistaking that the Beastwoman before you is experiencing now the keen pain of loss - her crimson eyes are dangerously dry, glittering with anger rather than tears, but a deep wailing sound keeps escaping her chest. She is whining, and she snarls as she steals glances at you from a short distance away.</DefaultText>
