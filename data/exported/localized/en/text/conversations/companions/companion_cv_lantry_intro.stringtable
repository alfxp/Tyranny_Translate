      <DefaultText>"For hundreds of years, the Sages have been devoted to the collection and preservation of knowledge.

      <DefaultText>"Or that's at least how it used to be. With the destruction of the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url], the Sages have been scattered to the winds.

      <DefaultText>"An understandable request. Let's see... born in Sunder, no kids - what few longings of fatherly love I've got in my heart are satisfied by taking care of carrier birds.

      <DefaultText>Lantry scowls, his writing hand becomes unusually still. "I once felt a rush of pride at that name - now it's a blight on our reputation."

Lantry clears his throat, reasserting his smile. "The [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url] was a beautiful sanctuary of parchment and ink. We had amassed knowledge from the Northern Empire to the coast of the Tiers. It would take a score of lifetimes to learn all the Citadel could teach you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But the Sages in charge of the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url] thought themselves above [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' rules. The Overlord learned the Sages were copying and spreading lies and forbidden knowledge."

"[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] put an end to life at the Citadel with his [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Fire." Lantry stops, putting a hand to his face. "All that knowledge set aflame..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"When we bind books, we bind them to last - our most important tomes were warded against fire and other maladies."

Lantry scowls. "So many of the books remain intact as the shelf and floor melt away. I suppose it's still there, if you want to brave danger and certain death for it. There is good reason they call it the [url=glossary:burning library]Burning Library[/url] now."

He shrugs.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"When the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url] was set aflame by [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url], I fled as fast as my knees would carry me. Every direction seemed a bad idea, but heading to [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url] seemed the least suicidal option... mind you, I was laboring under the misconception that the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url] had surrendered, and the fighting in the valley had stopped."</DefaultText>

"The [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url] nabbed me and several other Sages moving through the valley. The other Sages were sympathetic to the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url]. As for me, I just agreed so as not to get everyone killed.

      <DefaultText>"It won't surprise you to know their strategy is largely non-existent.
