      <DefaultText>"So, you've dragged me back here for... what? The end of a glorious campaign?" Verse huffs. "Let's not waste another second. Do whatever you need to do."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Truth be told, I'm surprised we got this far in one piece. I can't say it's been a pleasure, but I'm glad to see this conquest at an end. Time to give [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] a piece of your mind." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Opportunity. I can feel it like a coaxing breeze. Not since [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] stood against [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] has anyone made such a dent in the Overlord's defenses. It has been an honor serving at your side, come what may. I'm ready to face it." Barik nods to you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Human [url=glossary:prima]Prima[/url] has bared fangs at Alpha. Means [url=glossary:prima]Prima[/url] called [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] does not know how fearsome, how vicious, and ruthless, rough-savage Alpha truly is." She snarls. "Is time to strike at throat. To bite-gnash-devour meat of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' neck and drink down flooding death-blood." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's incredible what you've done to get here. I think you can take it another step further... and I want to be at your side when it happens. You were the first one who didn't twist me to suit your ends, and I'll never forget that. So let's finish what we started."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So this is it. We've come a long way since Edgering Ruins. I never... before this, I was nothing important. One [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] killer among thousands. But we're really doing something here. Thanks for letting me tag along."

      <DefaultText>"Back at the Spire - everyone's favorite destination for pissing off [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]. This has been a long time coming, Fatebinder. I'm ready. But I hope you're prepared for whatever's ahead." </DefaultText>

Now... don't you have a gratuitous display of magic to show the Overlord? I'm wet with anticipation."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This makes me uneasy. I wonder if we'll ever truly be ready to face the Overlord. [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] is a power the likes of which we can't imagine." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Following your progress has been... well, one of the great pleasures of my career. You've shown yourself to be something greater than even I expected - I had rather self-indulgent fantasies of being the primary authority on the world's most fascinating figure." 

"I'm eager to see wherever this takes us, my friend."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This is new territory for us all. You're the first to strike a blow directly at the Overlord. Make sure it counts. Hope you don't mind if I stand back and take notes. By all means, continue." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Thought [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] was most clever hunter. But now human [url=glossary:prima]Prima[/url] has challenged Alpha to Kills-in-Shadow. Has provoked deadly predator to strike." Purpled lips peeled back, she grinds her fangs, eager. </DefaultText>

      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Beastwoman and Alpha to Kills-in-Shadow have slaughtered many, tough challengers in fight for survival. Have hunted Archons and rip-ravaged whole armies. If [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] was in Tiers-lands, Shadowhunter would tear out human [url=glossary:prima]Prima[/url]'s throat, consume fear-flooded heart, and scent-mark human's mangled bones. Alpha, too, would do same."

The last surviving Shadowhunter hunches on all fours, her back arched, head thrown back to the firmament as she howls loud enough to shake the Tiers. 

"Is beginning of new season, of time to hunt human called Overlord."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You've done great things to get here. Just imagine what you could do if you continued on this vein? Show [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] what we do to tyrants. I'm ready to stand at your side and see it through."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Mmm. That would be a riposte for the ages. If it were up to me, we'd debate the matter until [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces were upon us. You had better hurry."

      <DefaultText>The waves of energy radiating from the Spire draw you forward, pressing your body and mind to its eager embrace. At the center of this tide, the resonator stands ready to broadcast your voice, echoing your commandments to the farthest reaches of the Tiers, and beyond.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>From here, the highest point in all the peninsula, you could, with the sum total of your effort, project your will far north, past the edge of the Tiers, and proclaim your [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] as far as the lands of the Northern Empire.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You know that there's only one equivalent response to the Overlord's aggression. You need to cast an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] on the Northern Empire - [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' seat of power. Nothing less will do as a gesture of your authority. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your words are barely perceptible over the wind until the first peal of echoes ricochets back from the valley's mountainous ring, at which point, the echo makes further speaking a bit confusing.

The actual definition of your words are lost in the echo, but a sonorous flood of your voice fills the valley with the sound of a distant thunderclap.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Whether or not your precise wording is audible at the target of your [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] is merely a matter of whether or not your victims need to know. So long as your voice can touch the realm, your will shall be enacted.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hm." Barik studies you for a long pause. "The [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Storms helped to craft the man I am today... for better or worse. This might be exactly what the Overlord's hierarchy needs - a little mischief to toughen them up." </DefaultText>
