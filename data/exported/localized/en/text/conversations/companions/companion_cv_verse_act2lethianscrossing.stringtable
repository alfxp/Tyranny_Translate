      <DefaultText>"Now here's a familiar face. The last time I saw you, [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] was ready to cave my head in with that violently overcompensating mallet of his." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"First you leave me in Edgering Ruins, and then you don't even let me join the assault on [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url]. If I didn't know any better, I'd say you're playing hard to get."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Funny that we cross paths again, Fatebinder. Maybe we got off on the wrong foot at [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url], but the Overlord's death sentence tends to bring out the worst in people."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We're not exactly playing for the same team anymore, so I think I'll leave out the particulars. Suffice it to say that [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] has kept me busy since [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Voices was curious when you arrived at Edgering Ruins, and he's curious about you now. He has a way of recognizing... call it potential. And he doesn't like potential slipping through his fingers."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You already knew I was a spy, so don't act like this is some great revelation. If anything, it's convenient for the Voices if he knows that you know. By the way, it's safe to assume we're being watched and reported on right now... in case you were interested." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"[url=glossary:the voices of nerat]The Voices of Nerat[/url] has agents all over the Tiers keeping an eye on spots that interest him - where tensions run high or the balance between order and chaos seems fragile. All things considered, the Court is pretty tame at the moment. Not much to report."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm still supporting the Tiersmen. It hasn't made me popular with [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That's what they tell me. Wish I had been there to see it myself. Well, I'll allow that everyone is entitled to a good idea from time to time. Keep it up."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>"If you say so. I have my doubts about old iron-clad, and I'm far from the only one. Just keep an eye on him. It's no secret that the Voices has accused him of showing his age."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Maybe not, but you had the guts to recognize that their approach to the war wasn't working. So whether you want a Tiers free of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] or just a more orderly surrender, no time like the present to get started." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I've considered that approach from time to time, but the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] always makes a better offer. I swear though, the day that this gets old, I won't have any scruples about quitting and moving on."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Even if I did leave without telling anyone, that might not mean anything to [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url]. He has a way of digging his claws into people no matter their allegiances."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Believe it or not, I'm between gangs at the moment. The Voices has me intercede on gang business when it's convenient, but I think he prefers me more as an agent for hire."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The next time I get involved with a gang, I'd rather be the boss. Wrangling new recruits and beating them into shape has always kind of been my thing."</DefaultText>

      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well, seeing as [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] wants me to keep an eye on you, I'm hard-pressed to reject an offer like that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"[url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] might have an objection or two up his sleeve. Have you stopped to consider the old man and what he would think of our little arrangement?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>35</ID>

    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm willing to put the past behind us. All that bickering over [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url] and the rush to impress [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s agent soured me to the war, but things are clearly getting more interesting with you around." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You couldn't get rid of me fast enough in [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url]. Far be it for me to question what goes through your head at any given moment, but it's passing strange that you'd come crawling back at all."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Putting down a few louses won't cost me any sleep, especially if they couldn't defend themselves in the first place. The Voices would probably thank me for culling his weakest recruits. Still, you're kind enough to ask."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Laying it on a little thick, aren't we? Listen, if [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] even touches me, I won't hesitate to shove a dagger in each of his eyes. That's what I call conduct. Take it or leave it." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If you say that now, then it doesn't bode well for our future together. I'm not in this war so that I can show a healthy sense of restraint. You sure that I'm what you're looking for in a hired killer?"</DefaultText>
