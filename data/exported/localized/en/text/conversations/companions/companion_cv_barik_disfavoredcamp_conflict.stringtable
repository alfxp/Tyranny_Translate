      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder, I can't claim to understand your motives or your reasoning. The oathbreakers and the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] are to blame for the problems of this siege, and you seem to think that sponsoring this chaos will somehow solve it?" 

"I would strongly urge you to turn your back on these... friends of yours and throw your support behind the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You know what? Forget I said anything. You're blind to wisdom and deaf to good advice. If by random chance we happen to survive past the Day of Swords, I'll be sure to report you to Ashe, [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url], and any soldier who will listen, because your recklessness and treachery cannot be allowed to pollute our mission!"

      <DefaultText>He studies you for a moment and allows some of the tension to leave his shoulders. "If you say so. That you trust in the oathbreakers at all is cause for alarm. They are our enemies for a reason." 

"Take care with your loyalties, Fatebinder. You may have earned [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s confidence, but mine is less certain." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You lied to the Great General. You have no intention of leading the assault with the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url], and what's more - you made me complicit in this treachery!"

He balls his hands into fists and locks his arms in an aggressive stance.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You betray the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] to our faces, and you expect me to join you in a fight against my countrymen? I may be pledged to your service, but not even [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] would hold me to that, given what you intend!"

"Unless you turn around right now and state your intentions to stand by our side with the Iron Marshal, you can consider me ejected from service on the grounds that you're a traitor!"</DefaultText>

      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Shut up. The Binder is using something called rational thought. Maybe you ironclads have suffered too many concussions to remember it. Instead of battering your shield wall against the enemy a hundred times over until it works, why not use a little ingenuity and take [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url] from the inside? Fucking crafty when you stop to think about it! Craftier than another of your 'Great General's' dumb strategies to get the rest of us killed." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Your every idea is poisoned by [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url]! He breeds treachery in his subjects, and for all I know he's looking through your eyes right now." Barik shakes his head with disgust.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, that hurts. But I've said my piece. Wherever you go from here is up to you." Verse turns to you and shrugs. "Take it easy on him. He's having a... really bad day." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>He raises his arm, the tension in his elbow building until he simply lets it fall again. "I'm done with you. I stand with the iron legion, and I will stay true to my vows even as you take a steaming, traitorous shit all over yours."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His manner shifts from open derision to curiosity, fascination. "Those are the most sensible words I've heard out of your mouth, and in spite of everything, they are... refreshing." He nods. "I'll stay back and fight with the legion. With any luck, we won't see each other on opposite sides of the battlefield... or ever again, for that matter." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Very well... I will remain at your side, provided that some sanity comes of this, and in the end it serves the cause of the North." Barik stands at ease, still trembling. "The stress of following you alone will lead me to an early grave."</DefaultText>
