      <DefaultText>The Stalwart captain whistles a shrill note as you approach, and his comrades lurch to attention. He turns to regard you with open distaste. "Tuck your tail and scamper back the way you came. The [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] won't tolerate Northern scum getting in our way."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Belay weapons, the Fatebinder approaches!" You hear your title repeated in hushed tones by a gathering of [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] soldiers. Their leader steps forward with a bow. "I received word of an ally in [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s court, though I doubted my ears at first. I'm Gregos, and this," he points back to his men "is what remains of the fourth citizen cohort of the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url]. We are honored to meet you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes... a special assignment." Gregos coughs nervously. "It feels a bit of fool's work, but I don't make a habit of questioning our captain." He points at the ruins rising up behind him. "We believe the First Regent's remains rest within this expanse of the Oldwalls - a rumor we cannot afford to ignore, as he carried the Steadfast Insignia - our most prized artifact."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The First Regent was lost in [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' storm - we've found nothing of his remains or regalia. Old writings at Rust Canyons showed that he meant to come to these Oldwalls, but there's no trace of him outside."

"The esteemed [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url]," he points to a tall, older gentleman standing at the edge of the camp, "says he found evidence all but confirming that the First Regent wandered into this nearby breach."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But those creatures of mist attacked us when we tried to enter the Oldwalls." he shakes his head, as his voice becomes quiet and his eyes cast downward, "Killed a couple of my newer recruits and one of the Sages that offered to search with us."

"Now we sit... wait... nurse our wounds. I can see panic in their eyes, but I'll soon have to order another foray into the Oldwalls."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We've all heard tales of the fiends that sometimes lurk near the Oldwalls. The honorable [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] assures me that literate men know them as 'Scourges'."

"Whatever you call them, they are abominations - not flesh and blood, but able to claw through the living all the same."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Between you and me," Gregos' voice grows quiet as he steps close to you, "I think these Scourges are servants of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] - guarding the Oldwalls, spying on us, reporting to their master." He shrugs. "I'm just speculating. Maybe ask the [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url], Hieronymus, what he knows."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"In a manner of speaking." Gregos glances at the man in camp festooned with ink vials, quill pens, and scroll cases. "The Sages were independently researching the fate of the First Regent. Once they learned of our common interest, they insisted on sending representatives to assist our efforts. They have been with us since our time at Rust Canyons."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We started with Hieronymus and his scribe, Javala." His voice cracks on the last word.

      <DefaultText>His back stiffens. "We're not talking about any old bit of bronze scrap. The Steadfast Insignia has..." he searches for the right word until it comes to him with a nostalgic tone, "meaning. Real meaning to the people of Stalwart."

"The [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] have never lost to a foreign invader," he taps the back of his gauntlets three times, "and through the ages, the Steadfast Insignia has been worn by every First Regent to lead our army."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Something about the Insignia rallies our countrymen. It's a symbol of the First Regent, but over the years it's come to represent something more." Gregos looks to his feet with a sigh. "We have always bent in the wind, never broken. If we could recover the Steadfast Insignia... I wager we could even march through [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' storm without taking a scratch."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Gregos looks at you for several long seconds before smiling and nodding. "If you would be willing to explore the Oldwalls on our behalf, we would be in your debt. The breach is nearby - overrun with those terrors. We didn't venture all that far before we had to retreat, so there's no telling what lies in wait further in."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Speak with [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] Hieronymus before you enter the Oldwalls - no doubt he'll have better knowledge of what to expect."

      <DefaultText>He points to the stone horizon behind him. "My crew and I've been stuck risking our necks over some antique hunt.

If I had a hot tip on the whereabouts of the First Regent's remains, I wouldn't share those details if I could make the find on my own.
