      <DefaultText>Hope reflects in her expression for the first time. "Is it truly as simple as that? A clerical formality to spare an innocent life?" She huffs as much in surprise as derision. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I, Amelia, formally abdicate my daughter's claim to the Regency of Stalwart - dissolving all ties, compacts, vassals and holdings. We forfeit all protections and advantages given by the ancient bloodline." She pauses. "Was that enough?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You feel a familiar sensation - the air growing hot and electric, before suddenly erupting in overwhelming waves of energy.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Perhaps there is a way to circumvent [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' law. I must research the matter."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You might be on to something. There's a rich tradition of getting around these types of formalities, especially during a time of war." 

"The only competent resources I would recommend are the [url=glossary:burning library]Burning Library[/url] and [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s court."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This seems unnecessary at best." Jagged Remedy grumbles to himself. "But I'll abide by it. We'll remain here until you return with answers, or change your mind." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I dislike the uncertainty of this..." Mattias studies you with a thoughtful expression. "I guess I'll stay at Sentinel Stand until you come back with answers, or a change of heart."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Should we not enforce [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' law rather than go around it?" Dimitris frowns. "Either way, I'll remain here with my men until you come back with a decision. I recommend you speak with General Ashe about the matter."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Thank you for looking into the matter. I'm sure that no answer could elude a Fatebinder of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] for long. I'll stay here with my daughter - we have nowhere else to go, anyway."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You will not have my daughter!" Amelia draws her weapon and lunges towards you.</DefaultText>

      <ID>14</ID>
      <DefaultText>You deftly step aside and grab her wrist as she passes, twisting the blade into her chest. Surprised, she delivers a hollow gasp as the air expels from her lungs. Before she even has time to realize what went wrong, you lower her warm corpse to the ground. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I see." Amelia regards you with cold stoicism. 

The moment breaks as a shriek rises to her lips, and she lunges at you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Thank the Regents! Have at it, then. What's your idea?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Silence descends upon the hall. For a moment, it seems as if the winds outside have halted their dance.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A loud crash against the hall doors breaks the stillness. Outside, the storm begins to whip about furiously, sending dust and debris into the chamber. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You were in danger, and we came to your aid... How many hundreds of Northerners did we lose to the storm, only to hear this?"

Barik mutters to himself, seeming to have trouble pairing what he hears from what he knows.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They took my unit in a night ambush - killed our lookout and overwhelmed the rest of us before we could stage an organized counterattack. When they took me prisoner, I was the picture of disobedience the entire time, and paid back much of the Northern blood they had spilled." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They locked me up behind the walls of Sentinel Stand in isolation. I gave them no lack of trouble, so they left me to my cell. Straydus the Younger, the Regent's son, he visited almost every day to check in and make sure my every need was seen to."

Her brow furrows. "In the legion, they teach you what to expect of the South. Barbarians, savages, rapists. I hadn't expected to find civility." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Shortly after, I heard an ironclad force assemble outside of the fortress. Had I a voice in the legion, I would have told them to pull back. I was being treated with dignity, and we suspected that [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] would come in short order... not that any of my father's simpletons would have listened." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Regent comforted me in my isolation. We had both lost the man we loved. And in no time at all, I realized that I was carrying his grandchild." 

She turns to you with a guarded look. "You know the rest." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Very well, then. If you have any ideas about how to handle our... our situation, then I'm open to them."</DefaultText>

      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I continued to debate and banter with Straydus the Younger. He hated the North, and I the South, but beyond our prejudices we discovered more in common than we suspected... much more."

"I later learned that he suffered wounds at [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] hands, and died in the field." She takes in a deep breath and shakes her head. "My Straydus... that was when I knew that the Archon of War had come for me at last."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You were lucky. Some of us actually come from the Tiers, and have been around long enough to know better." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If this works, I'll owe you more than I can possibly repay. Here. The [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] damaged this trinket, but you might still find it useful."</DefaultText>
