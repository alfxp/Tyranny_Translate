      <DefaultText>The [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] soldier folds his arms in a tight knot as you approach. 

"Irentis, formerly the personal guard of Regent Haptia. At least before the war made short work of her. Now I run with Mattias and what remain of the true patriots." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He offers a curt nod. "I'm sure you have plenty to discuss, but right now I'm more worried about the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url]. Our fearless captain wants us to submit to the feral dogs howling at our door. I can't allow that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He waves you off with disgust. "Survival at what cost? You don't have a clue what it means to live outside of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' authority, so I wouldn't expect you to understand."

"We value more than our masters and whatever arbitrary system of law they impose. We have more to lose, but we will risk everything to protect it."

      <DefaultText>"Mattias seems to have lost the confidence and motivation we all once shared. His mood is poisonous, and unchecked it can only soften our entire unit for conscription."

      <DefaultText>"In old Stalwart, it was the custom of Regents to each carry an artifact of power. One of them wielded a blade called the Dauntless. This was more than a mere weapon, but a rallying symbol that inspired the troops."

"The Dauntless was lost in a battle near the Oldwalls. With [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces and the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] plaguing the realm, the sword is said to lie wherever it last fell."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If you were able to salvage the old blade, it might be enough to inspire Mattias and rally the soldiers for a push against the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url]. Even if we all died - at least we would preserve our heritage!"

      <DefaultText>He turns to the soldiers. "Stand with me if you wish to fight as children of Stalwart, and die fighting those who would take our land and bury our customs! Fatebinder, you divided our coalition with empty promises.
