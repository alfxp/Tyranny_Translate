      <DefaultText>"I was in Azure during the conquest. Back when [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] declared himself an enemy of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], our forces panicked. We didn't know who we could trust. When an Archon goes rogue, you can depend on his supporters falling in line." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I want to appeal my ruling. By the letter of the law, [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] made the right decision. I don't dispute that. But the spirit of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' law is another matter. I was putting down a suspected traitor, not lashing out in anger. These things happen in war."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I can speak to that. The truth of the matter is we were leery of the mages since the conquest began. They seemed better at ease in a book than a battlefield, and I've never trusted anyone who could read."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"None at all. I spent most of my battles supporting the phalanx from the rear. It's important duty. Even if it isn't the front lines, a lot of good soldiers depend on you."</DefaultText>
