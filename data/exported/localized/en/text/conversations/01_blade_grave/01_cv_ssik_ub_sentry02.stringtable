      <DefaultText>"A stranger... and they let you through?" Wearing an uncertain expression, the scout grasps his weapon.

      <DefaultText>"I protect the ruling bloodline of Stalwart! Our country's leadership is secure while I stand in its defense, and none of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces will move me from this spot!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The keep is stocked with provisions enough to last us a century, though the Regent hoards much for himself..." The soldier's gaze veers in doubt.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You came all this way just to glare at me?" The Sky Blade raises his weapon. "Stop looking at me like that! Stop it! Stop it!" Shaken, he begins to advance with his weapon drawn.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Did I... did I hear roaring a minute ago?" The sentry trembles with his weapon drawn. "I can only guess that that's my countryman's gore on your boots, invader! I warn you that I'm ready to put up a better fight, and your fragile shrieks won't unnerve me!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He blinks and takes your measure. "My reason compels me to doubt your words, but something in your bearing tells me you speak truth." He sighs. "You've wasted your time, outsider. It is up to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] to end this [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url], and nothing will move the Regent to negotiate." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I think the Regent mistakes his place in the matter. He is the one who suspends this war with inaction, and we will be only too happy to strip him of that distinction."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That sounds like a challenge to me. If you wipe the grit from your eyes, maybe you'll see that we've come with more than honeyed words at our disposal." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I suggest you turn back the way you came, however it is you got here, and inform your superiors that we will not be budged." He hesitates and prepares to speak further.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I..." He pauses and regards you with new respect. "You may be right, but I have a duty to protect the Regent and the dignity of my position. I won't hesitate to take up arms against you if you try anything reckless." He speaks as if the prospect gives him no pleasure. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I wish that Herodin was more inclined to negotiate for a better option, but he's leaving that responsibility in [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' lap. He acts as if he can wait out the storm until it passes, but the rest of us aren't so sure." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fool! Did no one tell you that [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] has all but ended the Regents and their weak line? These storms will rage until Herodin dies, and by the time he gathers the courage to take matters into his own hands, the country you protect will be no more."</DefaultText>
