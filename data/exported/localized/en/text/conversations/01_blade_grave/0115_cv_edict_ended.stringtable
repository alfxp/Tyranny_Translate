      <DefaultText>The winds buffeting the keep have abated. Outside, an eerie silence pervades the air, a stillness that hasn't visited Stalwart for a long time.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You can hear the very symbols that brought the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Storms into being - each syllable proclaiming itself from a newfound corner of your mind. It would seem the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] is now a part of you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The keep is empty, and all sounds of battle and wind are gone. You have won a great victory, but nobody is here to witness it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Evidently there was much of Straydus Herodin that I didn't understand. Perhaps in time..." 

He brushes the matter away and composes himself. "The age of the Regents is over, and Stalwart can begin to recover. This is a great victory, however it may feel."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You've demonstrated the lengths you'll go in the service of allies, and the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] are fortunate to be included in crafting the Tiers to come."

"I make for [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url] and your coalition. We have fought to retake our country for so long, I hardly remember what it feels like to plan from a position of power." He smiles. "I suppose I'll find out."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The death of the babe... a terrible thing. And yet we've returned so much life to these beleaguered lands. I don't know if anything can redeem this act, but the legion may venture to try." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The stalemate between the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] and the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] is at an end, a victory that can't be measured in rings. Thank you, Fatebinder. I'll remain at Sentinel Stand to secure this location, and send word to Ashe of your excellent work." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Thank goodness it worked! You spared my daughter... and here I had come to expect nothing but cruelty from the servants of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]." Amelia looks to the crib. "Now we have a chance at what might never have been. A life outside of these walls." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My father can be severe and uncompromising, but I'll return to Iron Hearth and his protection... at least while the conflict persists. Hopefully he isn't so consumed by war that I can't still appeal to him as a man and father. I always appreciated them more than the Archon."

"I regret none of the decisions I made to get here. We'll disagree on that much, but my daughter will be safe."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I hope you're worthy of this accomplishment, son of Stalwart." Barik sighs. 

"I'm glad to see the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] ended, at last. My armor feels... not as heavy."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Preserving all that make the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] right - our deeds, our honor - that will be absolution enough. The babe had the blood of the North, after all. She would have wanted that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You're even more touched than I thought! That baby wanted nothing more than a safe home and a family to love her! Don't put your misguided loyalties on someone who didn't even know where she was!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>At first you think the force of arcane power dissipating is enough to carve the skin from your bones, a sensation you attribute to the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Storms - but it cools just as quickly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't know what will become of us. The [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] would despise me for supporting the Regent. The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] would not have me after turning my back on the North."

"I don't regret my choices for an instant, but they leave me without allies or kin. My father... I can't say what he would think, but he's a rigid, uncompromising man..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Do not consider it for a second." Mattias frowns at Amelia, struggling to find the words. "You were tossed up in this war like anyone else, and circumstances are not always kind. No one but [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] and the Regent are at fault for perpetuating the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Storms, and even Straydus..." Mattias sighs. "Even Straydus had his reasons." 

"Your child is blameless, Regent or no. I would... I would apologize for the severe tone I took with you earlier, and ask that you remain with the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url]." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She studies him for a moment, and then the tension leaves her shoulders. "The South continues to surprise me. I had not expected anyone to march on Sentinel Stand under a banner of mercy." She nods. "We accept." </DefaultText>
