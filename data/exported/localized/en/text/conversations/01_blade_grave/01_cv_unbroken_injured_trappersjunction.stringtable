      <DefaultText>You spot a soldier lying in a slump. Through the mud and blood caked on his tattered garb, you can make out the colors and insignia of the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url].

He fights through pain with each of his ragged breaths. As you approach, he shifts his head slightly towards you, but does not appear to have the strength to look up.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So this is it, then. Just kill me quickly. I'm in no state to continue on like this." His forced smile sends a trickle of blood out the side of his mouth. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You deliver a swift blow to his head. The last of his energy leaves him as he crumples to the ground.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He raises his head and takes a look at you while wincing. "The [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url]. They've been driving us across this wasteland, pressing their attack at every turn. Looks like they finally got us cornered in this pass."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I was part of the first line of defense. When my comrades got wiped out, the Chorus went on through. I thought myself lucky they didn't check for survivors. After a few hours, I started to change my mind." His wry smile quickly turns into a wince of pain.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The man bursts into a coughing fit, and an ugly torrent of blood spurts from his mouth. His gasping for air turns into gurgling as he finally slumps over and stops moving entirely.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He coughs up a glob of blood and looks at it with bemusement. "I don't have much time to regale you with tales of Stalwart history, I'm afraid. I'd rather spend these last moments remembering the true color of the sky..." He focuses up at the dirty wall of stormclouds overhead.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There's blood on your boots, soldier." He coughs to himself and shakes his head. "I wager it belonged to Elia and her unit. We received a bird with a panicked, hasty message... but it told us to beware of travelers." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He coughs, spilling more blood on the earth. "Don't you come any closer. I've seen what the gang bosses do to people. That sick bastard, Jagged Remedy..." He trails off, wincing in agony.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Wouldn't expect one of Ashe's brood to carry bandages. You ironclads can practically regrow limbs... though if you came from [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s Court, I guess I don't know what you can do." He tries to laugh, but it elicits too much pain.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Very optimistic of you, but his wounds are too severe. I could attempt a healing spell, but I fear it'd merely prolong his pain and give him little more than false hope."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Is this strictly necessary? I could mix up a sedative and... oh you're going to kill him... forget I said anything."</DefaultText>
