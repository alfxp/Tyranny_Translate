      <DefaultText>"The Regent remained in Sentinel Stand for her protection. The [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] was his responsibility to shoulder, not hers." She tips her head down in challenge. 

"My daughter will not be another victim of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' conquest. She has the blood of the North coursing through her veins, and no one has the right to take her life." </DefaultText>

"No. If you spare the child - the Regent - then the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] will withdraw their support from your campaign. Our nation's future has rested in this moment, and you propose doing nothing!"</DefaultText>
