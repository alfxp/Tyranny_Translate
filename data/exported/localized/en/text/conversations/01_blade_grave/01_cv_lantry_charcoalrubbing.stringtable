      <DefaultText>Lantry nods. "Agreed. If we collect enough sketches and imprints, we could no doubt reconstruct the original image in its entirety."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you work, Lantry hovers near. "See how that pattern looks broken along two edges - I think there's more to the engraving than what's here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Though the drawn rune remains incomplete, it seems likely that the completed design is symmetrical in nature. Should the need arise, you could reasonably guess its original shape.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The parchment contains a partial charcoal rubbing of a rune, though the shape is incomplete. The curved lines are unusual and don't resemble any known sigils. It will be necessary to obtain the complete shape before you can discern its purpose.</DefaultText>
