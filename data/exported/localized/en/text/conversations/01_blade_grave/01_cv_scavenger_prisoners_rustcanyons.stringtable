      <DefaultText>"At last!" one of them sighs as the prisoners crowd the exit.

"I thought for sure we'd be shipped off to the Candle Mountains!" another says as he files out of the cage.

As the prisoners turn to leave, the last one grabs your hand and says "Thank you, stranger, were it not for you I... I shudder to think what they would have done to us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Killing caged warriors now?" Eb shakes her head, her upper lip twitching. "Shall we pilfer from the blind next? You're a shit-licking coward, Fatebinder.

      <DefaultText>"If you think the Chorus is any sort of 'life,' then you haven't spent any time on the front lines. I know just from fighting them - from seeing the glaze in their eyes - that serving [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] is just another kind of death."

He glances to his countrymen and nods. "We respectfully decline." </DefaultText>
