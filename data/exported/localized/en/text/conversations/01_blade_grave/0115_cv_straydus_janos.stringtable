      <DefaultText>The Regent stands with the last of his soldiers, bracing for combat. "You can't take Sentinel Stand! Without a Regent to sit this throne, this nation would cease to be Stalwart. Mind me, boy, I won't hesitate to kill you if you try. This nation means more to me than any single one of you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The time of the Regents is long since past, Herodin. You could have ended the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] any time with your blood. Instead, your cowardice has cost you your countrymen and your claim to the throne." Janos sets his mouth in a hard line. "There's nothing for you here. We won't be ruled as we were."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You kept the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] alive, monster, and it's eroded all that was once good about this country. [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] couldn't have destroyed us without your compliance."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You would judge me as well, then?" Straydus barks out a pained laugh. "After you killed how many thousands during the conquest? These very halls are reduced by your presence. I have no choice but to cleanse them of your stain." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You first, Regent. Only one of us needs to die to achieve true peace, and I elect you to the honor." Janos rushes toward Straydus with his weapon drawn. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If I didn't surrender to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] all this time, did you think I would give in to the likes of you?" He spits. "I am the blood of old Stalwart, the persistence that kept us standing, the strength that kept us together! I surrender to no one."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Good, because I would have killed you anyway. I will personally feed the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] as much of your blood as it needs to stop, and I won't think twice about doing it." Wearing a grim look, Janos makes for the Regent at a sprint. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You... you don't know what it means to be the capstone of a nation at war. To sit at the center of a storm and know that you could just give in." He flares his nostrils and turns to you. "I cannot give up the dream of Stalwart. We are a united people, and no storm can unmake us!"</DefaultText>
