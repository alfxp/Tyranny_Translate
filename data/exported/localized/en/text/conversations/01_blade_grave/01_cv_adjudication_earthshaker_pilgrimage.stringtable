      <DefaultText>"We both know that you don't have any assignment. Archon Ashe specifically said that he wants his mages pulled back to the fort." The soldier nods off to the tents. "Return to your quarters. You'll know when you're needed."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm taking a pilgrimage to the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url]. The time has come to visit [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url], the fallen Archon of Stone. When he lived, the Earthshakers Guild took great pains to follow him and learn by example. Now that he's dead - or dying - we can but study his corpse in repose."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What nonsense. You rock-worshippers owe allegiance to Archon Ashe. He allows you to study your spells under [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' protection. [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] would have led you to rebellion and death." At the very thought, the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] soldier touches the hilt of his sword.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It goes against Ashe's orders, but even I must admit that it sounds like a useful pursuit. I'll try to get the others to see the reason behind it, but you know how they can be." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Since [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] can no longer teach his students, it behooves us to go out and learn from him. It's not a question of devotion or loyalty. [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] is the wellspring from which our arcane power flows. There are few other resources that can teach us about our art, and none as potent as [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"By Ashe's orders, yes, but the reason should be clear. In life, [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] was a disgrace - a rebel, a murderer, and a volatile powder keg."

"In light of his... transgressions, many came to doubt the Earthshakers and their devotion to our cause. Their duty at present is to remain in the fort and earn back our Great General's trust through deeds and consistency." </DefaultText>

      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Think of it as learning through [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]. Everything we know of our art came from the Archon of Stone. Imagine what we could learn if enough of us clustered around his remains?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We would take that knowledge back to our service with the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url], of course. [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] has been very generous with his patronage of our guild. We only seek to repay him in kind."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They want to learn from a dead Archon?" Eb shakes her head with a wicked smile. "Perhaps they should have paid attention to [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]'s teachings when he was alive, sound like he was taken for grani-" she narrows her eyes, looking angry at something far away, "taken for granted."

"Now I've certainly had my share of meditation over the waves and spent far too many hours looking at the sky. I know that arcane inspiration can come from the oddest places. But still... what possible knowledge could a rocky husk impart that the living [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] could not?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The guild coffers don't run as deeply as they used to, but I can scrounge together a few rings as 'travelling expenses.' Will that do?"</DefaultText>
