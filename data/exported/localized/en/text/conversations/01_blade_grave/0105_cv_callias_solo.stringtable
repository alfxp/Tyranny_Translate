      <DefaultText>"Part of how the Regents maintained their dynasty was by way of inheritance. Houses Straydus, Sender, and Aspison amassed, over the centuries, a small trove of relics and guarded them fiercely down the generations. There's the magical sword the Dauntless, whomever the lead Regent was always wore a fancy helmet, and one of them owned an ever-burning lamp... among other things."

      <DefaultText>His head snaps back from the blow, and he recovers cradling his jaw. A moment later he shakes his head and spits out a tooth.
