      <DefaultText>The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] soldier mutters to himself and stares down the truncated length of a broken sword. "Rusted piece of garbage. Wasn't even worth the trouble of carrying into battle. Better off in the hands of a farmer tilling his field..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"At the start of the conquest, I requisitioned an iron sword from the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url]. Since they settled in [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url], I figured it wouldn't take the span of the entire [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]-be-damned war to get the blade assembled and ready for battle."
