      <DefaultText>"Commander, I think what we have here is a failure to understand each other. I'm no pushover, and unless I'm mistaken, you're no fool." The [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] captain crosses his arms and speaks with his [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] counterpart with a critical air.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You would be a fool to think the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] will agree to a total unconditional surrender. We control the [url=glossary:blade grave]Blade Grave[/url]. We've held this region during fair weather and foul, as [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] could attest. If the Overlord couldn't leverage us out of this nation, how do you think you'll manage?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I offer surrender to spare your soldiers' lives. You've dug your claws into the region, true, but we've cut you off. The fort is in disrepair, and you'll never see another supply caravan if I have anything to say about it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The captain shakes his head with a smile. "Your tactics are showing their age, Commander. Duskwatch is stronger than you think.

      <DefaultText>"Don't make the mistake of underestimating the Great General." Osmios glowers at Agathon with unrestrained fury. "Your predecessors did the same, and their bodies are caught up in these foul winds." 

"Stalwart is on its knees, and we need only to bring the sword down once to take the head off your sorry excuse of a resistance. Last chance. We know that you're holding Callias. If you release him and surrender, the lives of your soldiers are in safe hands."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You've probably noticed that the fort has seen better days, and our garrison may fall short of repelling a [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] attack." He frowns. "I couldn't let on to that idiot Osmios that our defenses are weaker than they look." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Fatebinder, at last." Osmios beams. "You might want to reconsider the terms of surrender I offered, Agathon. With [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s finest around, they aren't likely to be repeated." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A broad-shouldered [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] captain stops just short of the opened gate. He looks you over with an uncertain frown.

      <DefaultText>"That would be Mattias. He was a decorated captain in old Stalwart, but his common blood kept him among the rank and file. When the last of the Regents hid for their lives during the war with [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], Mattias rallied together communities and disparate people to re-form the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Duskwatch always held the military strength of Stalwart, while Sentinel Stand was the well-defended seat of the Regents. These walls may not look like much, but there's no lack of pride here." 

"Still... that may not be enough to hold our resistance together. The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] are attacking our forces in earnest across the [url=glossary:blade grave]Blade Grave[/url], and these outposts of strength are disappearing." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The death of Straydus Herodin." A frown creases his storm-weathered face. "That makes it sound murderous and petty. There are real reasons behind our goal." 

"The [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Storms will persist while the last of the old Regents still live. As Stalwart crumbles to ruins, Herodin stubbornly refuses to die - protected behind the walls of his fortress." 

"The [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] just want their country back. We have to fight off the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] and reach Sentinel Stand, but we're nothing if not committed to putting Herodin to the sword."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He chuckles. "I'm not surprised that Janos sent you. He's gambling man, and quick to trust... unlike me. I make no secret of our intentions.

      <DefaultText>He stiffens in momentary discomfort. "I hate to deny you, but that isn't my call to make. You'd want to speak with one of our top lieutenants, Elia. She's encamped somewhere in Rust Canyons."
