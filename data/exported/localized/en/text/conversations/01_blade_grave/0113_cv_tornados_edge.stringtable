      <DefaultText>"Nothing has changed. This is the very storm that shattered the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] and [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] alike. Thank you for bringing me here, Fatebinder." Barik regards the windwall and the massive tornado around the inner keep, which is but a distant outline.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Verse holds her ground, the storm whipping through her hair. "I wonder if I could ride that storm. What do you say we find a barrel, seal it up with me inside, and see what happens out there?" A moment later she sighs. "Eh, maybe not."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Regrettably. The General's daughter and members of her cohort were captured in the second year of the war. By the third, we had tracked her to Sentinel Stand. We knew that the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] was coming, but thought it worth the risks. The battle dragged on longer than it should have, and we got caught in the storm."

      <DefaultText>You catch an odd sound in the wind - a low moan hidden within a cacophony of swirling dirt and metal debris. The clouds of dust seem to close in upon you. Within them, you see patches of glowing red...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A year of brutal weather will do that. [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' [url=lore:edict_storms]Edict of Storms[/url] devastated the once-mighty Realm of Stalwart, all but wiping it from the map.

      <DefaultText>"This is what we're up against, and this is why the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] couldn't take back Stalwart!" He shakes his head at the windwall and sighs. "Among other reasons."

"I conscripted into Jagged Remedy's gang for the chance at making it through to Sentinel Stand, but so far all I've gotten are some fresh bruises and a shitty nickname."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That they are. And just beyond them, Straydus Herodin, the last Regent, sits in the comfort of Sentinel Stand." 

Mattias spits into the whipping wind. "During the war, we kept the fortress provisioned to outlast any siege, so it's safe to assume that Herodin won't starve to death. We'll have to find another way to make it through these winds."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Apparently it's the first step of initiation into a Chorus gang. The rest is open to the interpretation of whichever gang boss happens to be in charge and how they like to welcome new recruits." He grimaces. 

"Without getting into any detail, I can say that Jagged Remedy is a sick fuck. The journey here wasn't my finest hour."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I..." He hesitates, glancing away in discomfort. 

"The initiation rites were severe. Jagged Remedy makes sure that his new recruits are too degraded and spoiled for any other gang to want them." </DefaultText>
