      <DefaultText>"Agathon sent me a bird, so I thought we'd cross paths eventually. You must have really carried your weight at Duskwatch to impress that sanctimonious braggart."

She frowns, wiping a line of sweat from under her brow. "But here I am getting ahead of myself. I'm Elia, leader of this camp... for lack of a better word."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I got a bird from Mattias that told me to expect you. Didn't believe my eyes at first - he doesn't normally get that excited, so I took it for a Chorus trick." She shrugs. "Sorry for doubting." 

"If Mattias says that you're important to the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url], then I'm willing to believe the sentimental dung heap. I'm Elia, the leader of this..."  she gestures to the sorry camp behind her, "this hovel of dust-choked worms." </DefaultText>

A few short clashes later, we had to pull back. We've sent ravens with pleas for aid, but our enemies keep shooting them out of the skies."

      <DefaultText>"So is everyone and their sister. The [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] are hedging a lot of bets on getting inside Sentinel Stand ahead of the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] so we can end the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Storms."

      <DefaultText>"All of that aside, I came here on Mattias' orders with a small group. We weren't supposed to draw attention..." she shrugs, "and you've seen how that's gone." 

"Rust Canyons sits atop the resting place of fallen Regents, who each carried a powerful artifact that could help us against the storms around Sentinel Stand. This siege is in the middle of a great big salvage operation."</DefaultText>
