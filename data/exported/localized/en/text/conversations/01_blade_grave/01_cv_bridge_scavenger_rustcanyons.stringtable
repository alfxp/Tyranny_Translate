      <DefaultText>"Furl your sail, stranger - this bridge marks the beginning of [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] territory." He scrapes his blade on the planks in front of him, drawing a line. "[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces already tried to best us, they got this far."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The bridge sentry offers a noncommittal nod. "You're back, and the bridge is still off-limits. Change comes slow to Stalwart, you see." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He pauses to count on his fingers. "Long enough to have sons twice, at least. After the storm, I thought [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] would be satisfied with our pain but... the Overlord still finds reason to kick us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We know these canyons like the backs of our shields, and we're not going to allow a bunch of pig-headed ironclad jackanapes chase us away." He huffs with pride. "It takes a special sort to outlast a siege or a long campaign. Stalwart-born folk like myself have it by the wagon load."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The sentry scratches his chin and sizes you up. "Nothing the likes of you would be interested in. If you're about to ask 'Well, why are you defending it?' then don't bother. We've got provisions, equipment, and [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] soldiers. Reason enough."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I know you for what you are, Northerner. I never met a woman or man from [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' domain who didn't try to 'invite' my countrymen into the fold. I'll give you this chance to leave. Otherwise, I'm prepared to give my life defending this bridge... meager though it may seem." </DefaultText>
