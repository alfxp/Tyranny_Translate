      <DefaultText>"Well, well. Look what we have here." The gaunt Crimson Spear clears his throat and regards you with detached, analytic interest. "A fresh slab of meat to slice open and pick apart by candlelight. What will it be? Come quietly, or come noisily?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The heavily-armored Crimson Spear is presently occupied using a sharpened piece of bronze on a self-inflicted wound in his forearm. He glances up at you and grimaces - from pain or from recognition, it's difficult to tell.

If any of them felt sympathy for the Chorus, they'd have had plenty of chances to join already - I doubt you asking will win them over.
