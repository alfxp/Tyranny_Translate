      <DefaultText>Verse stands above the crib. Moving too fast for any eye to follow, she jabs down once with her dagger and withdraws it, wiping the blade clean on a blanket. The baby doesn't even make a sound, but you hear one less breath being drawn. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Rising to her full height, Kills-in-Shadow towers over the squat crib. She splays her fingers wide and reaches, slowly, down inside. Then she jerks her arm in a single, violent swipe, and the deed is over.

Afterwards, she looks to you with sheening eyes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>After a prolonged hesitation, Sirin intones a soft lullaby, rocking side to side on her heels and humming. The Regent heir slowly closes her eyes. 

As the baby slumbers, the tempo of the song begins to slow in tune with the baby's breath, until both come to a stop at the same time. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Sirin stares at you, her eyes filled with both hate and tears. "You can't be serious, Fatebinder - not when you know what I have told you. Do not ask me to do this. I can't. Not again..." Her voice cracks, and she continues to stare at you.

After a few moments, she looks down and whispers a single word, "Please..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I guess that's the most any of us can ask for, isn't it?"

She glances to the crib with a quizzical expression. "Think of all the things she won't see. And yet she's about to go somewhere I've never been."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Eb leans over the crib, her hands delicately tracing sigils in the air with slow, measured precision. You hear the sound of crisping frost and a momentary gust of chill as she finishes tracing the pattern.

Eb turns to you with a solemn nod.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Barik carefully picks up the baby and cradles her in a nook between the spikes on his armor. He rocks her in his arms, humming gently, and then jerks his hand with a sharp crack. He lowers her back into the crib, his hands trembling.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Lantry produces two vials of colorful liquid. He mixes them together with a watchful eye, and leans over the crib to deposit two drops in the child's mouth. Within moments, she falls silent.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Sirin stands motionless, staring at the still form lying before her. Her shoulders shake with silent sobs and her knuckles turn white as she grips the edge of the crib. Finally, she turns to you, eyes red.

"I hate you for this, Fatebinder."</DefaultText>
