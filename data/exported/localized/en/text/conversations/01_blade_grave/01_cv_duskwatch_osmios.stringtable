      <DefaultText>The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] commander wears his armor over broad shoulders, and stands as if he knows it all too well.

      <DefaultText>"Before you get too excited, your job is to infiltrate the base under cover of night and extract the prisoner. Don't let anyone spot you. If you alert them while inside, you'll be on your own." 

"Callias is a good soldier, and he's been in [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] hands longer than anyone should have to endure. You might think him just another Stone Shield, but Ashe holds the lives of his troops in high regard, so we should consider the recovery effort as important as taking Duskwatch itself."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There are a few structural weaknesses along the perimeter, which should help you sneak in. After releasing Callias, open the front gate from the inside." He flashes you a toothy grin. "We'll flood the keep and make short work of Agathon's soldiers."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Eager, are we? Good!" Osmios pats your shoulder. "Make your move as soon as night falls. Remember to stay out of sight, and go for Callias. We'll wait for you to open the gates from inside - but we can't help you until that happens. Good hunting."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His gaze turns stony. "It's no wonder you're working for and not with the legion. If you're enthusiastic to run headlong into a row of enemy spears, be my guest. Truly. I can't wait to see how it pans out. Just know that you're on your own, and I expect nothing more than to toe your fallen eyeballs aside when we take the fort without you." 

He turns away from you, shaking his head in as much amusement as confusion.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His interest piques. "Is that right? Well, welcome aboard! We're not without defenses, but we could always use an extra warm body to support the phalanx. The [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] are trying to enter Sentinel Stand, and we mean to put a stop to it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That old fortress is likely ruins by now, but it's a symbol of this region's strength, and symbols mean something in the North and South alike. The army that controls Sentinel Stand controls the [url=glossary:blade grave]Blade Grave[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Duskwatch is a critical foothold. We can fan out troops from here and destabilize any [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] activity - including their plans to breach Sentinel Stand. The fort will fall into our hands, but my hope is to mitigate [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] losses as much as possible.

      <DefaultText>"With all due respect, Ashe's daughter means less than a dented goblet to the Overlord. [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] is above such matters, and wouldn't pause to take the girl's safety into consideration, much less yours or mine. Besides, the Great General knew the risks of sending his daughter into battle. He wouldn't let his feelings compromise the war effort."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A gang of Tiersmen with delusions of honor. I'm sure they wish their ranks were as renowned and elite as the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]. Unfortunately for them, the best they'll ever do is die by our hand, or surrender and face hard labor."

      <DefaultText>He smiles bemusedly. "Strangely enough, there's no love lost between the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] and the old establishment - a hereditary bloodline known as the Regents. With that much division in their ranks, I don't know how they hope to succeed."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I did have an organized plan to take this fort, but it required a subtler touch - not to mention time for my forces to recuperate from our last assault.

      <DefaultText>He glances to his left and right with a frown. "I hate to question the Great General or his command, but we're overworked and undermanned. There won't be any additional supplies coming our way until the fort is in our hands, and the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] set up their defenses with a long siege in mind." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Day and night my forces have battered themselves against those walls, but even the tireless [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] have their limits. I'm afraid we're out of commission until [url=lore:edgering_asheaegis]Ashe's Aegis[/url] takes the edge off and knits our wounds closed. You look lively enough.

      <DefaultText>"During the conquest, we pushed through the Stalwart defenders like they were old hedgerows, but these [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] are a breed apart from their countrymen.

      <DefaultText>"We dispatched cohorts of soldiers to recover her unit, but we had to pull back our efforts when the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Storms hit. Navigating the region became less organized and more a matter of chance. I'm sure that Ashe has worried himself sick wondering about his daughter's safety." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He studies you for a moment before bursting into laughter.
