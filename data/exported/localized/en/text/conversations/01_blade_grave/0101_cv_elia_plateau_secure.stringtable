      <DefaultText>Elia nods at you, her face showing the hint of an appreciative smile. "Many thanks - we won't forget how you bled with the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url]. Since we're both still standing, I'll keep my word to you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The battle is over. The clash of iron and bronze that filled the air has ended, leaving only the storm's wails and the last, ragged gasps of a dying soldier. Elia ascends the path leading to the blood-soaked plateau and moves towards you, pointedly stepping over a [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] corpse the way one would a fallen log.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's still strange to me that the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] served the interests of the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url], but I suppose many things are strange in times of war. With Mattias conscripted into some gang, the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] will have to continue without him. Shame to lose a good captain..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Regent Epistratos carried the Helm of the First Regent, but he was caught unawares when the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Storms hit without warning." Elia glares at you, seemingly ready to speak, and then her severe tone falters. "I suppose you did what you had to during the war, like the rest of us... Here's a map with the spot where the Regent fell."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Mattias sent us hunting for the remains of Regent Aspison. Before the war, he was known for carrying an artifact called the Steadfast Insignia." Her eyes twinkle as she says the name.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's a symbol of Stalwart's determination in battle. Before the war, Regent Aspison wore it pinned to his cloak, and his soldiers grew more daring on the battlefield when they saw him enter the fray."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They say it can marshal forces to stand tall against any threat, and give them the strength to march with purpose without taking harm. When you think about it, I'll bet the Insignia could let an army stand against [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' windwall. You could even stride into Sentinel Stand like you were enjoying clear skies." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We were looking for the Regent's body. Instead we found records of his past movements. Just after the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] hit, he was on his way to what we now know is a breach in the Oldwalls. I couldn't say what he thought he would find there, except its wild dwellers and an early death." She frowns at the thought. "If he planned on unleashing the Bane on the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url], I might have told him he was as dumb as Ashe's hammer." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We sent a small team led by one of our best - Gregos - to investigate the breach. It's said to be a cursed place, and crawling with Bane. Likely as not, the Steadfast Insignia is there."

"Gregos travels with a small contingent of Sages. Who better to bring on an expedition into the Oldwalls than some dusty librarian?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There's no direct road, but a breach in the Oldwalls is said to lead to the Ocean Spire's floor. If you're dead set on making the journey, you'll come across worse foes than the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url]." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I heard tell that she was captured in the second year of the war. A unit under the command of Straydus Herodin took Amelia's cohort by surprise."

"The prisoners were scattered to different locations, but Amelia - the true prize - ended up at Sentinel Stand. Presumably she's still there." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Our leader, Mattias, was searching for the Dauntless before his forces got pinned down by a [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] gang. I haven't heard anything since I received a hasty, panicked bird, so I assume the struggle continues." </DefaultText>
