      <DefaultText>"Ashe says the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] are scavenging the [url=glossary:blade grave]Blade Grave[/url] for an old Stalwart heirloom. I can think of nothing else that would help us breach Sentinel Stand, short of the Regent's timely death."

"They're not making it easy by holing themselves up behind walls. If the conquest is any evidence, Stalwart folk are less inclined toward facing their enemies in open battle." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No matter what they find here, the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] are trapped. North of camp, we have soldiers led by my subordinate, Jacomus. To the south, reinforcements march as we speak." He taps his chin in thought. "Still, I would appreciate any help you can offer. The sooner we claim that [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] artifact, the sooner we reach Sentinel Stand."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, the search for artifacts certainly changed how we view this garbage pit. In truth, Rust Canyons presents us with some strategic advantages. Our location brushes shoulders with Iron Hearth and Duskwatch Fort."

"If we could claim this spot for the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url], that would be as good as controlling the whole region... kind of. Sentinel Stand is still the real prize of the [url=glossary:blade grave]Blade Grave[/url]." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The lieutenant holds up his sword and squints through the obscurity of the high winds. "Who goes there? Oh... it's you, Fatebinder. I wish you didn't have to witness that crude exchange before. Elia and her lot have caused me no lack of trouble."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ashe sent word to expect you. If he dispatched an outsider to help us in the field, that says something about his urgency to see these [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] conquered for good. I think we can both appreciate that his interest in seeing this matter resolved is of a personal nature." 

He catches himself. "I... apologize for that 'outsider' remark. Some of us aren't accustomed to working with anyone but the legion proper."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They've built a fortified camp due east of here, and another group holds a choke point to the southeast." He huffs. "Though calling it a 'camp' gives the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] too much credit.
