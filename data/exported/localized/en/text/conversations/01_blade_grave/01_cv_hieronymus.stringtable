      <DefaultText>Tapping the squib of his quill with an ink-smudged index finger, the tall man smiles wide. "Well met, Fatebinder of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]," he bows as he greets you. "I believe your fame precedes you... alas, mine does not. You may know me as [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] Hieronymus."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Hieronymus shakes his head with a sigh, gesturing toward the massive stone horizon of the Oldwalls. "It lies within... but no good discovery is without its pitfalls."

He points toward a wide breach in a nearby section of the ancient stone facade. "The [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] and I were attempting to recover a few relics of interest from the Oldwalls, but a swarm of Scourges put a halt to that plan."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I am Hieronymus, journeyman of the School of Ink and Quill. I scribed under Gavers Crane and seventeen tomes are bound by my hand."

He coughs, his gaze at his feet. "All other details are just vanity... I am more accustomed to studying others than extolling my own facts."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My research suggests that within these nearby Oldwalls are a set of stones carved with ancient script. For lack of a better term, I call them Stones of Elucidation." His hand darts to his satchel, producing a hand-drawn sketch of an ordinary circle.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The worst?" He looks at you with a puzzled smile, his mouth moving in several half-starts.

"The Oldwalls are filled with arcane beasts that attack erratically, and with little warning. My colleagues can only speculate on what they are or what possible sustenance - if any - they find in the Oldwalls. That said, if you see one, it would be unwise to approach it and ask clarifying questions."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You've returned?!" Hieronymus blinks in surprise. "I mean... I obviously knew you'd return - just pleased to see you is all."

He swipes one of several quills sewn into his upper sleeve and dabs the squib. "Tell me of your experiences - in your own words and time, please."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Hieronymus' eyes widen in delight as he examines the stones. "Fascinating. I had expected to see a few duplicates with existing specimens."

He examines each stone, wrapping them in linen swaddling with care.

"Thank you, my friend. This will prove vital to our understanding of the glyphs used by the builders of the Oldwalls."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The long feather plume of his quill dances to the tune of the [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url]'s furious scrawl.

      <DefaultText>Hieronymus' face reddens, his face twists into a nervous smile. "I suppose..." He crumples the parchment note and begins scrawling anew. "...I suppose the record need not divulge the private affairs of a Fatebinder of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His back stiffens as his grip on the quill tightens. He looks nervously about in either direction, seeing trees to either side and the Oldwalls behind him.

With broad, sweeping pen strokes, he begins scratching out his note and sighs. "I choose my writing hand." He holds his scowl for several seconds, before exhaling and putting on a smile.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Not currently," his arm instinctively lifts up, his gloved hand raised slightly above his ear, arm crooked to create a landing surface for a bird. He looks skyward, blinking as he searches the clouds for several long moments.

"My Sunder dove is carrying another missive at the moment. When she's returned, there may be room on her bindle for a note or two."</DefaultText>

      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's just a simple trinket to the untrained eye, but every First Regent since before the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] earned that name wore the badge into battle. Stalwart folk are ever famous for standing their ground, and the Steadfast Insignia embodies their immovable nature - the wearer can resist any charge, push, or shove."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Hieronymus' eyes widen. "I could speak volumes, honorable Fatebinder, but I will summarize."

"The Oldwalls predated settlement of the Tiers. The passageways crisscross the landscape, but most good folk steer clear. [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' laws forbid entry, which hasn't always been a problem for us, but even we saw the good sense to stay out."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Explorers have found old artwork, funerary remains, and other relics of a civilization predating our own."

Hieronymus lets out a long sigh as he looks at the towering wall behind him. "But most find a quick death in the Oldwalls - as the current inhabitants are inhuman predators - creatures of arcane power that appear to travel on the mists."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"As we find more of these stones, we can compare commonalities in sigils. With a large enough collection to study, we hope to crack the language of the Oldwalls. Who can guess what we might learn then?"

Hieronymus blushes. "It's been a slow process. Constructing dead languages without living witnesses is singularly frustrating. It is a tall request, but I doubt [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] selects fools for Fatebinders. I could use someone with your mettle to brave the Oldwalls."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We recovered a torchkey during our ill-fated first attempt to breach the Oldwalls. I have seen fashioned stones like it before, but what we don't know about them would fill a library." Hieronymus points with a shaky finger. "Unfortunately, when we were attacked, we got separated from Gregos' men, and one of the soldiers still has the torchkey. His corpse does, to be exact."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He smiles, pointing to the ground, where heavy footprints are visible under layers of rust and sand. "The layers of rust let you judge the age of footprints here in the [url=glossary:blade grave]Blade Grave[/url], and these tracks heading into the Oldwalls date back to the opening days of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' storm."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My working hypothesis is that the only person with her feet on the ground during the peak of the storm would be the bearer of the Steadfast Insignia." Hieronymus aims his finger along the footprints in rust until he's pointing at the Oldwalls. "But I suppose we won't know for certain until we look."</DefaultText>

      <ID>66</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Such a steep request!" his eyes widen with surprise before a smile creeps over his face. "But you certainly have refined tastes... and it would be an honor to have a Fatebinder annotate a manuscript of mine..."

He scratches his chin for a long moment before slowly nodding. "Help me and I'll pay you in the future with something bound just for you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He looks at you blankly. "That's... that's it? I thought you were going to shake me down for my last copper ring."

He tilts his head to the side and looks you up and down. "I don't make it a point to modify the record, but help me out and I'll aggrandize your role in my telling of the deeds."</DefaultText>
