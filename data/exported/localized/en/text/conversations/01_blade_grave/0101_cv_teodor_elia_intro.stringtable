      <DefaultText>An [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] soldier struggles to rise to his feet - one arrow lodged in his shoulder, the other in his thigh. He attempts to stand, but his muscles are too weak for the task.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] soldier calmly approaches from the west. He regards the vulnerable Southerner with a curled lip and a disapproving shake of his head.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] soldier turns to the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] camp, frustration evident in his tone. Then his gaze shifts over to you, and back to the walls.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You see a woman stride purposefully into view atop a platform along the wall's edge. She lifts a spear and hurls it at Teodor, cursing under her breath when it breaks against the rocks. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Weak and broken. Prisoners make for poor sport. Your escape was spirited, but damned foolish." He raises his sword and points it at the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] man's heart, poised to let it plunge and impale him to the filth-strewn ground.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He turns to you in bafflement, squinting across the dust-strewn expanse, recognition barely evident in his gaze. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I've had better days, maggot, but even if I die here... at least I can number this one as the day you didn't force me into a stinking gang for the amusement of your Archon." He spits. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You ironclads don't usually ask questions before you start shoving spears in our guts." He hacks up a wad of bloody phlegm. "Surprised you can even string words together." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I can't recognize friend from foe in these winds... If there's any mercy in your heart, I beg you help me!" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Before he can continue, you both catch the sound of iron boots trudging closer.</DefaultText>

      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>The soldier lacks the strength, but none of the conviction as he fights to move in spite of his wounds. He's powerless to scramble away as a [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] officer approaches from the west.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>In one swift motion, he plunges his sword into the man's heart, pinning the fallen soldier to the rusted earth.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Is this really necessary?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The soldier looks you up and down. "You're that Chorus rat who got under the General's skin in [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url], aren't you? If you're here to conscript these Southerners, I'm only too happy to spare them the agony." </DefaultText>

      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>His sword wavers as he notices you. "Ah, Fatebinder. I hope you've come to tidy up the mess these vermin caused for us. But to answer your question... Ashe has deemed it so, so yes, it is." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>He frowns in your direction. "You're... no, not that Fatebinder from the Apex siege? You might have had the authority to stay my hand before you turned your back on the General, but I'm afraid Ashe's orders are the only ones I take." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>He regards you with a perplexed expression. "And why would I ever do that?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Elia! It looks like all of your pointless digging has drawn the Chorus. How much longer do you think those walls can stand while all of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces rally against you?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I have reinforcements now, Elia! If you open the gates, I can still make this easy on you." He passes you a knowing glance that suggests he's lying and proud of it. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Reinforcements or strangers, Elia?" Teodor calls up to the ragged defenses. "Not one of mine and not one of yours, I think - though it's difficult to tell you apart." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Are these your allies now, Elia - traitors and miscreants who break wars rather than win them?" Teodor shakes his head. "Better that you open your gates to me and preserve your dignity." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her expression sours. "I raised these walls to keep idiots downwind. You're no friend of Teodor's, but I don't know what you are to me."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No shit. One ironclad or two, it makes no difference. These walls can stand against [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' fury and your pig countryman's saber rattling."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"If you're here, maybe my days of shitting in a dirt hole are finished. Scamper back to your Archon with your tail twixt your legs, Teodor. I think my reinforcements arrived first."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I am so. Fucking. Tired of listening to you. Go shriek at someone else's fortress for a change, and stop trying to impress me by hunting down unarmed prisoners. Maybe the ladies of the North get shivery over your bravado, but all it tells me is that your codpiece is emptier than your skull." She takes note of you with a raised brow.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Make no mistake, Elia. You would be better served as my camp slave than as my enemy. Such a waste of good potential." He tips his head to the west. "Fatebinder, let's consult when you have a moment." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"He's your problem now, Elia. I'll be back to claim that garbage heap you call a fort." Teodor aims you a hard glare and steps back into the obscurity of the winds.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText>"She's your problem now, Elia. I'll be back to claim that garbage heap you call a fort." Teodor aims you a hard glare and steps back into the obscurity of the winds.</FemaleText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I gave you a chance to surrender and be my camp slave, Elia. When I hoist you onto a pike, just remember that you had a choice." He glares at you and steps back into the obscurity of the winds.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>She spits over the edge. "How's that for your courtly greeting?"</DefaultText>
