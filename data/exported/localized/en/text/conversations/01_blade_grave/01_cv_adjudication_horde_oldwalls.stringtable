      <DefaultText>"You're only hearing one side of the story. Fatebinder. Our scouts observed this wretch readying to enter the Oldwalls.

      <DefaultText>"I'm sorry, is 'readying to enter' the best you have? Because I could just as easily argue that you're 'readying to get knifed between your shoulder blades,' but it doesn't count for shit until I see blood and bronze."

      <DefaultText>"There was no gang - just a lone opportunist out to make her fortune breaking [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' laws. The scouts could tell just by looking at her that she was headed for the breach."

      <DefaultText>"Never. I grew up in the Tiers. Even we knew better than to go inside the Oldwalls - if not because of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' law, because the things lurking inside were like to eat us." </DefaultText>
