      <DefaultText>The Regent lies on the ground, bloodied and defeated. He extends his good arm and drops his weapon. "If only I had the breath to spend defying you. But I fear... the fight has left me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What a moment to witness - the last of the Stalwart defenders shattering under the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] boot." Dimitris beams with pride and rears back to kick Herodin in the head, but stops himself. "I'll give you the honors. Let's kill this wretch and put an end to the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] at last." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You filth!" Mattias grimaces at Straydus. "Don't expect sympathy after what you've done. It wasn't enough to keep the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] alive - you fought us to protect it. Stalwart is finished with your miserable reign, and we'll be stronger without you." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A-Amelia! Is that you?" Dimitris' weapon nearly falls from his hand as he salutes. "I hardly recognized you. Why... why are you fighting with the Regent's personal guard?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The gang boss looks at the woman with amusement before recognition dawns in his eyes. "Aren't you [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url]'s missing whelp? I knew that you were a prisoner in Sentinel Stand, but I had assumed..." He chuckles. "I don't know what surprises me more - that you're alive, or that you wear Stalwart raiment."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A gasp echoes in the shadows of Barik's helmet. "Amelia, alive! But you come to the Regent's defense? What is the meaning of this? Explain yourself, girl." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>From the intensity of her gaze to her squared jaw, you know this woman hails from the noble bloodlines of the North. Her [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] raiment throws you for a loop, until you recognize her for who she is - [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url]'s daughter, Amelia.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What a joke." Mattias wears a quizzical frown. "If you had come to this conclusion sooner, you might have joined us as allies in the fight to reclaim Stalwart. If you fight for the Regent, then it doesn't matter if our motives are similar. You have to die." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"By whose definition of the word? Not yours, I'm sure. No, you and the rest of the Fatebinders are nothing but mouthpieces for [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' law - a system you barely understand and my father kills to defend!" </DefaultText>

      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No! This is the most sensible I've ever been, and it's because my father isn't here. You're not [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url], so I don't expect you to understand, but he's..." She struggles to find the right words, as if discovering them for the first time. "He's a commanding presence. When he's around, it's like his opinion is the only one that matters." 

"I don't know if that's because he's older than everyone here combined, or because he's an Archon, but it's true. Iron Hearth is where opinions go to die." </DefaultText>

      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>She sets her stance and glares. "I'm honored to lay down my life for the Regent. When your bloody work is done, you can go back to my father and tell him that I was loyal to his enemies through the bitter end."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He turns to you with a resolved expression, and you know he's almost lost too much blood to maintain it. "I am the last of the Regents. If you mean to end the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Storms, then I accept my fate."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Mattias moves to your side. "Let me kill the Regent. My people have fought for this moment, and the nation has lost oceans of blood because of his hateful decision."

He glares down at Herodin with disgust. "Won't you let a son of old Stalwart take vengeance on the one who laid us low?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The gang boss looks at Straydus with a lingering frown. "I can just tell that this one isn't going to come peacefully. Judging from blood loss alone, he won't survive being carried out of this fortress." He sighs. "The Voices will be disappointed, but it couldn't be avoided." He glances at his newest conscript. 

"Should we offer Brown Bottom here the honor of dispatching the last Regent? It looks to me as if he's champing at the bit for the opportunity."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Kill the Regent, Fatebinder. Let's put this shameful chapter of the conquest behind us, along with the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Storms." He spares a final look at Straydus Herodin. "You should be proud, Regent. In death you'll accomplish more than you ever did in life." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Straydus kneels before you and presents his neck. "Please, show mercy. Not for me, but..." He closes his eyes and lets out a breath. "Do it already. Do it. Coward, do it now!" </DefaultText>

      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>Straydus' body falls to the ground, and you watch the blood pool onto the floor in silence. There is a feeling of anticipation in the air, but as the seconds pass, it never materializes into anything. The surge of arcane energy and sense of relief you experienced in [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url] is missing. 

You hear the howl of the storm outside, and realize that the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] endures.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Curious. I understood that the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Storms would abate when the last of the Regents died." He glances your way. "Could we have been mistaken?" </DefaultText>

      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>Searching for any change or meaning, Mattias scans the room with increasing panic. "It's not happening. Why isn't it happening?! The storms were supposed to stop when the last of the Regents fell!"</DefaultText>

      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>Dimitris furrows his brow in confusion. "The last of the Regents is dead, and yet [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' storm continues. What could we have possibly missed?" </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What..." Barik shakes his head. "[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' storms are only supposed to rage while the blood of the Regents lives on." He scans the room with a suspicious eye. "Did we miss something?" </DefaultText>

      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>The terms of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] were clear - the storms should only rage for as long as the blood of the Regents lives on. 

Something is wrong.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You deftly step aside and grab her wrist as she passes, twisting the blade into her chest. Surprised, she delivers a hollow gasp as the air expels from her lungs. Before she even has time to realize what went wrong, you lower her warm corpse to the ground. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You might be on to something. There's a rich tradition of getting around these types of formalities, especially during a time of war."

      <DefaultText>Hope reflects in her expression for the first time. "Is it truly as simple as that? A clerical formality to spare an innocent life?" She huffs as much in surprise as derision. </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>105</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I, Amelia, formally abdicate my daughter's claim to the Regency of Stalwart - dissolving all ties, compacts, vassals and holdings. We forfeit all protections and advantages given by the ancient bloodline." She pauses. "Was that enough?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>108</ID>

      <ID>110</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Thank you for looking into the matter. I'm sure that no answer could elude a Fatebinder of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] for long. I'll stay here with my daughter - we have nowhere else to go, anyway."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"End myself to end the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]? No, Fatebinder. That is not our way.
