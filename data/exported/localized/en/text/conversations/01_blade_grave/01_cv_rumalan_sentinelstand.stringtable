If the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] breach Sentinel Stand before we do, I'll have every one of you vermin flogged bloody while the Great General watches!" [url=glossary:iron guard]Iron Guard[/url] Rumalan grimaces and worries her throat, raw from barking orders over the fury of the storm. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"For [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] and Ashe!" Rumalan pumps her fist in the air. "Glad to see a new ally in the field. We're regrouping on the far side of this bridge. Clean up the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] mess here and join us." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She shakes her head. "It's a good thing I take my orders from [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url]." She frowns at you in as much confusion as hostility. "I'll alert the General that the legion has lost any confidence we held for you. You're relieved of duty, Fatebinder."

      <DefaultText>The lieutenant bends at the waist and bellows at the top of her lungs: "Traitor!"

      <DefaultText>"That thing? Looks more like a cloak pin from here, but these winds haven't been kind to my eyes." She nods toward the windwall. "If it can get us through the storm and into the heart of Sentinel Stand, I won't question the will of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]. Lead on, Fatebinder." </DefaultText>

"Don't take it too personally. On second thought, go ahead and take it personally. I don't expect you to recall what an ass you were during the war, but the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] never forget." She makes a crude gesture with her hands and readies to turn away.</DefaultText>

She smirks and shakes her head. "See you on the other side, Fatebinder. Try and survive, won't you? If you live to see tomorrow, it will be more than a lot of good Northerners got. Here's to their justice." She makes another, even cruder symbol - this time with both hands - as she leaves you to the battle.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I wouldn't concern yourself over my punishment, Fatebinder. The Great General will give me a stern talking to about conduct and insubordination, but when I explain how you treated my unit during the war, I think he'll be more sympathetic to my cause than to yours."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Rumalan bristles at the notion, moving towards you before suddenly catching herself. "While I would love to bury you in the dust myself, I'll not risk our position for matters of pride. I have [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] defending the wall to the northeast, and an advance unit patroling the southwest... more than enough to take one Fatebinder."</DefaultText>
