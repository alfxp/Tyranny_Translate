      <DefaultText>Stalwart's ruler looks at you with a mixture of caution and amazement. His gaze lingers on the Steadfast Insignia. "That explains how you were able to pierce the winds... but why have you come? Not to liberate an enemy, I think."

He squints. "The long isolation has taken its toll, but we aren't deaf to news of the outside world. I think I recognize a Fatebinder when I see one, so logic follows that you are the keeper of [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url]." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We've survived in the Overlord's prison for over a year. I live on, and so the Regent bloodline endures.

He regards you with a hint of resignation. "You didn't travel this far to deliver terms of surrender, did you?" </DefaultText>

"I must warn you - I haven't survived this long only to be cut down by [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' lapdog. I endured the war, the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] suicide march, and the long isolation of this storm. I won't make it easy."</DefaultText>

"Your Overlord certainly works in amusing ways - the storms are the obvious attack, the more subtle strike is how this [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] brings out the cowardice and pride endemic to Stalwart.
