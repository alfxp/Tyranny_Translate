      <DefaultText>"I drew the short straw." He chuckles and shakes his head. "The [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] make a habit of patrolling the outer fortress in case the storm breaks or someone happens to emerge from the keep.

      <DefaultText>"If you have business within Sentinel Stand Keep, I assure you that it won't be happening anytime soon." He nods in the general direction of the swirling winds. "[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' anger has been raging without pause for the last year. It's bad enough that no one can enter or leave the inner keep." </DefaultText>

It stands to reason that Stalwart's last Regent is still alive in there." Janos squints at the distant tornado and shakes his head.

      <DefaultText>His friendly expression sours. "The Regents carried the bloodline of old Stalwart's ruling family. That link - any connection to the past, really - carries a lot of weight." He sniffs. "Maybe even too much."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Before the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Storms hit us last year, a Stalwart patrol captured a company of [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]. I know at least some of the prisoners made it to Sentinel Stand.

The flippant answer is to say they're all unthinking zealots, but put yourself in their footsteps.

      <DefaultText>"Maybe it does at that. You're not tied to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' apron strings as tightly as before, are you? Still, you strike me as one of those doing the right things for the wrong reasons types, right?" </DefaultText>
