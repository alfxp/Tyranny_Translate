      <DefaultText>The soldier blinks. "Barik? I heard that you were running with the Fatebinder, but I never really believed it until now." She flares her nostrils and balls her hands into fists.

      <DefaultText>"Ah, the Fatebinder of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]! Commander Osmios told me that I should look out for company, but I didn't expect anyone from this high up the food chain!"

      <DefaultText>"They don't come more decorated than Osmios. He stood up to the Chorus during the Stalwart campaign - something to do with [url=lore:beasts_stalwart]Blood Chanters and Beasts.[/url] Don't recall the particulars, but he's been our unit commander ever since." </DefaultText>
