      <DefaultText>"Need some cast off iron? Maybe a few teeth for a necklace for your special someone?"

The merchant drops one of her many satchels to the ground and pulls from it numerous tools and trinkets. "The scavengers do the gathering, and then I take it from them. Profitable work if you can manage it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Pillaged iron, scavenged bones? There are laws governing mercantile wares, and you're conveniently ignoring them."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Something flashes in her eye, and her voice lowers. "If the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] are so well-off that they can ignore my wares, they're free to do so. As it is, [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' army needs all the help they can get - and a friend of means is a friend indeed."

"If some misplaced morals stand in your way, feel free to buy elsewhere." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What can I get you, Fatebinder? There's iron and [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] plunder to spare. War is friendlier to those of us with initiative, eh?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She winces. "A shakedown, is it? I've got a few rings to spare, but I imagine your belt is mighty full. Tell you what - let's say I speak of you in glowing terms to the legion and we call it a day?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Aye... I was afraid you were going to say that. It's more profitable to spread a kind word here and there, but don't let me change your mind." She discreetly palms you a generous amount of rings.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Are... are you sure? Because I have an active imagination and a vulgar tongue when I'm around less reputable types than yourself, good Binder." She shrugs. "As you will. Consider yourself a disreputable thug as far as the legion is concerned." </DefaultText>
