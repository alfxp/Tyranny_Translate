      <DefaultText>"You took a legion hostage, and didn't have the nerve to meet us on the field of battle. Coward!" Dimitris advances a step. "I will earn Ashe's favor when I bring him your head, and no one in Stalwart will weep for your demise!" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Something in the Regent's demeanor shifts as he catches your eye. "So, the Fatebinder joins the fray. You must not like your odds if you brought so much backup."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Much as I loathe seeing you here, Fatebinder, I'm content to deal with two problems at once. Sentinel Stand will be won for the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] - not a despicable traitor." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It belongs to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] and Ashe, you stubborn fool!" Dimitris swings his weapon and advances. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm surprised that [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] fostered ambition like yours. The Overlord only seems to recruit dimwits that are easily controlled. Think you can handle us both, Dimitris? Your pet Archon is too far away to hold your hand." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Don't call him..." His face scrunches, but he looks between the two of you with a mixture of rage and concern. "I'll end you for that!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm finished compromising with you imperial dogs! If you want the keep so badly, come and take it from me. I have more than a few years under my belt, but I've spent most of them training for this day."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We must have really closed you into a corner, Regent. I've never seen you bare your fangs like this." Dimitris advances with his weapon drawn. "Good! I needed a challenge today."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] elected to ravage this country, but I refuse to give in to debasement and surrender!" He stands tall and squeezes his hands into fists. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I've been waiting a long time to finish what we started, Regent. You've sat with your cowardice and shame long enough, haven't you?" He draws his weapon. "If you beg me for death, I'll make it painless." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If you want to see me on my knees, you'll have to prop up my corpse for the delight of your inbred cohorts. But don't speak to me of cowardice and bravery. The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] needed [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' arcana to prevail in the end. I'm sure that an army of lice-bitten rats could have succeeded with those odds on their side." </DefaultText>

      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The only patriots here are those of us who showed up to ram the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] standard up your creaky stern. Come on, let's end the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] together, old man." Dimitris and his soldiers advance.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And here the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] go on about the honor and glory of war. They're just principled butchers like the rest of us." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Commander Dimitris, at your service. Ashe sent me to help you tidy up. What's say we stack up the benches and lock the door on this campaign once and for all?" He gives you an encouraging smile. </DefaultText>
