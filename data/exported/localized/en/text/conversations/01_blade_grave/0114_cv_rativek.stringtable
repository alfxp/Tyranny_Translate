      <DefaultText>"More than a fortnight ago, but she dashed off right quick before we could nock arrows. They're a cautious lot, but cunning. Not even [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] could have expected them to use the storm to their advantage."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The body has been here a long time, and the storm has long since eroded skin from bones. Tucked away in one of the gauntlets, you find the scrap of a distinctive battle standard. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That's the General's family crest! Amelia and her unit must have come through here... It seems a lifetime ago that we marched on Sentinel Stand. At least this proves we were on the right track. So close, too. The girl might still be alive out there." He looks to the windwall with regret.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ashe wants us to subdue the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] and restore order to the [url=glossary:blade grave]Blade Grave[/url], but I'm not giving up hope on his daughter. Not when we're this close! There's an [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] fort called Duskwatch. It's not far. Commander Osmios is staging an attack to capture the fort and take back Callias, one of the Stone Shields who traveled with Amelia who they took prisoner. He may be able to tell you something about what happened to their unit, or the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url]'s plan." </DefaultText>

I heard tell of an [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] fort called Duskwatch. One of our soldiers has been imprisoned there since around the time Amelia's unit went missing. I'll wager anything that if we shatter the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] defensive, we'll learn more about her whereabouts." </DefaultText>

The [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] can navigate the terrain as boldly as they please, and the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] wipes away all trace of their passage.

      <DefaultText>"Barik is correct, they took Callias captive - supposedly one of the Stone Shields who traveled with Amelia. You ought to make contact with Osmios, the commander in charge of taking Duskwatch. I'm sure he would appreciate the aid of a Fatebinder."</DefaultText>
