      <DefaultText>"My apologies for that. Irentis lost as much as anyone in this war, and his reaction is about what I expected. Surrender is a kick in the teeth, but it may be all we have left."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't exactly have my pick of good choices! Maybe it's better for us to survive alongside those barbarians than die here like dogs." He releases a heavy sigh. "Even if we're conscripted into [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' army, we could treat it as an opportunity to strike back at the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Doesn't it, though?" A weight settles off his shoulders. "It's refreshing that somebody understands our predicament. Faced with death or conscription, I would take my chances on the latter. Dead men can't serve the realm."

      <DefaultText>"I don't blame Irentis for his stubbornness, though. The [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] haven't exactly made the kindest of offers, and I'm not convinced myself.

      <DefaultText>His eyes widen, and the exhaustion that wore him down is replaced by a mixture of fascination and disbelief. "It's... it's the Dauntless. By thunder, I never thought I would see the Regents' blade shine in battle again..."

      <DefaultText>"Mattias, you've gone too far!" Irentis advances with a group of armed soldiers. "Those of us with common sense to spare are not following you into this black fate you'd hoist upon us. Draw your bronze so we can fight for our freedom, maggot." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Traditionally speaking, we don't. We haven't lost a battle on our home soil yet, and there's a lot of cultural pride wrapped up in that idea."

"But these days, the long battle with [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces drags beyond our ability to endure. Stalwart was mighty in its day, but the relentless tide of enemies will be our undoing." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's true - no one was cheering when the [url=lore:edict_storms]Edict of Storms[/url] hit us and destroyed most of our fighting force.

      <DefaultText>"Only limited by your short-mindedness." The other warrior turns to you and glares. "And now you dare to welcome a Fatebinder into our midst! Irentis. Charmed, I'm sure!" He spits at your feet and steps forward, taking a challenging stance against Mattias.

      <DefaultText>Irentis takes a step back, breathing heavily. "All of it."

      <DefaultText>He tosses another log in and the fire roars into life. "That only prolonged the war and cut us off from our home. Stalwart belongs to its people, not to some ancient line of inbreds. Even if that means siding with the lesser of the two evils... Well, let's say I'm not brushing any option off the table. And that includes lending our bronze to the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url], as despicable as the idea sounds."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He turns to the fire beside him and nudges it with a log, sending up a cloud of embers. "Our real troubles began with the victory at Sentinel Stand. Instead of facing [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces in the field of battle, the last Regent of Stalwart decided to barricade the keep and look after himself. When [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] proclaimed the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url], it [url=lore:edict_storms_resolution]cursed the Regent bloodline[/url] for their stubbornness." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A fair number of us were captured in our last scuffle. If the Chorus were to release those prisoners as a gesture of good faith, my [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] here would be more... amenable to the idea of conscription."

      <DefaultText>"If you manage to make any ground, you'll know where to find me." He tries to appear optimistic, but his enthusiasm wanes.

      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>He offers you a tired smile. "If the answer was easy, I would have done it myself. Use whatever charm or powers of persuasion you learned from court. I would see my men returned to us. Just knowing that they're alive and well would convince me of the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url]' good intentions." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My brethren have been returned to us! I don't know how you did it, but you managed to reason with the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url]... Or should I say the Chorus is more reasonable that I thought?" He frowns at the notion.</DefaultText>

      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>He takes a deep breath. "So be it. If the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] are willing to show this much good faith, we will turn ourselves over to their mercy."

"We couldn't take Sentinel Stand as [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url], but there is still a chance to liberate Stalwart from the [url=lore:edict_storms_resolution]oppression of the Regent and this Edict."[/url]</DefaultText>
