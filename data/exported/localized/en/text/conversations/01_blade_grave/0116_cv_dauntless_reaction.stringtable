      <DefaultText>As your hand touches the hilt of the sword, a rush of sensation courses up your arms as if you had dunked them in warm water. The feeling is at once calming and overwhelming, and leaves you breathless.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you grow accustomed to the sword's weight, your thoughts are drowned out by a perpetual buzz of voices - fragments of inspiring speeches, glorious battle cries, and the anticipation of triumph to come. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Dauntless... I saw that blade carve up too many friends during the Stalwart campaign. The locals rallied around it, sang anthems when it was drawn. It's every bit as meaningful to the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] as Sentinel Stand."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If ever you needed a sword big enough to cleave the Oldwalls in half, that would be it. Careful where you point that thing." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The feeling subsides as quickly as it struck. Dauntless pulses in your hand, its potential desperate for release. Your perspective is divided between holding a sword and holding a living symbol. The distinction, at times, grows hazy.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Scent of big, mystic-claw is bitter and biting on Beastwoman's tongue. Tastes of magic and blood. Makes Kills-in-Shadow yearn to cut-carve prey. To hunt-kill-slaughter many [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] with sword called Dauntless."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Congratulations. You pulled a great big sword out of a stone. I mean, I guess it's a pretty powerful weapon, but it looks filthy and probably weighs a ton. I hope you don't expect me to carry it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well fuck me with [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' cock, that's Dauntless you're holding - famed blade of the Regents of Stalwart! There's a lot of history behind that sword... although most everyone who cared about that history is probably dead. But focus on the positive - what a charming new toy you've found!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I've seen plenty of decorative copies in my time but... this is genuine - the Bane would not have gathered around a mundane imitation, it's the real Dauntless!"

Deftly snatching a quill and parchment, Lantry begins to sketch the sword. "You'll need to hold onto it... for posterity's sake, naturally."</DefaultText>
