      <DefaultText>"Ha!" Agathon pumps his fist into the air and delivers a hard kick to Commander Osmios' body. "What a day to stand against [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url]'s finest! Oh, Fatebinder - we wouldn't have won the day without you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You've been a tremendous help to the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url]. It seems only fair that we share what we know - as allies, if not compatriots." He beckons toward the pen. "Come, follow me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A Stone Shield stares at you without emotion before turning back to the captain. "Come to gloat, now that you've bathed in the blood of the North, Agathon? I've answered all of your questions. Leave me be."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm just a Stone Shield, but I was bound to serve [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url]'s daughter, Amelia." His voice falters. "It was my pride to fight at her side, and my great shame when Straydus Herodin's forces overpowered and captured our unit. The old Regent may be ten times as stubborn as his people, but he lacks none of their might."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You will cooperate with the Fatebinder, or face the same punishment as before." The look on the captain's face suggests he wouldn't mind a little defiance.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Amelia didn't die on the field that day. We were both taken prisoner, but I was moved here and made to suffer. The [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] hit shortly after, and I assume stymied any effort to recover us. If Straydus isn't a fool, then he's keeping her alive as a hostage for some future negotiation ploy." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His glare hardens. "I stood by her while many others fell around us. Just because I draw breath doesn't make me a failure. Even the Great General would understand that."</DefaultText>

      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Having Amelia means that the Regent can leverage a deal with [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url], if it came to that. We wouldn't want the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] to gain a leg up before we have a chance at killing Straydus Herodin. That makes taking the keep more important than ever."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That's the question, isn't it? Before he left, our leader Mattias instructed us to make Sentinel Stand our highest priority... even if we lost the manpower to hold Duskwatch."</DefaultText>

      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>He chuckles. "Believe me, what you've heard from Callias today is downright talkative. After he was transferred to Duskwatch, he wouldn't give us a word. If you doubt me, judge him by his wounds. They healed over time, but he remembers them. Don't you, Callias?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Unlikely. Ashe can feel the presence of his soldiers from afar - and that includes his daughter. I'd bet my boots that he's interested in taking Callias just to hide the truth of her survival from the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The prisoner clears his throat and straightens his posture. "You keep strange company, servant of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]." He glares at Agathon. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Much as I would like to back you, I don't have the authority. Mattias is the best of us, and the interests of the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] are folded up in his back pocket. I trust him to make the right call."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We have a lot of work ahead of us. Aside from repairing the fort and securing the location, we also have to make sure the men are equipped to march on Sentinel Stand." He stands taller and beams with pride. "They'll be ready."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He winces. "The [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] torture me, and [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url]'s protection heals my wounds. I don't fear for my life... but I've lived to see agonies that are better forgotten. Ask your questions."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That sounds like a worthy enough cause, and it could further the aims of the Guard and [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] alike, now that we have a shared enemy in [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]." Agathon nods with pride. "Very well. I'll do whatever I can to spread word throughout the [url=glossary:blade grave]Blade Grave[/url]." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Just before the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] showed up, I got a missive that caused me concern. I would have addressed it sooner, but..." Agathon worries his jaw and frowns. "Mattias and his men have been cornered in Trapper's Junction. If you can assist, then we may actually stand a chance of taking Sentinel Stand."</DefaultText>
