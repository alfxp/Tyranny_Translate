      <DefaultText>He advances a bold step forward. "This [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] - and your complicity in it - have done more damage in a year than [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces could have in a century!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You deserve nothing, save for the Fatebinder's judgment and the wrath of the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url]."

      <DefaultText>"Herodin! Our country has paid the price for your cowardice. If you had a shred of honor left, you would fall on your sword and put an end to this [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]." He grimaces. "But I suppose you're used to hearing that by now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You're that upstart captain I trained all those years ago?" He sizes Mattias up with a scrutinizing look. "I don't know what authority you think you wield outside of here, but within these walls I am still your Regent!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Given the low visibility through the storms, I suppose he can technically claim to be king of all that he surveys... and that just happens to be one tenth of one tenth of one tenth of what used to be Stalwart. Nice reign."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't mind telling you that I faced an impossible choice. While my decision may look like the coward's path, I challenge you to stand in my place wearing the mantle of command."

He offers a warm, tired look to his former countryman. "With any luck, you'll understand some day."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh, but you would be surprised how much we don't." Mattias glowers at the Regent with pity and disgust. 

"Your people stand ready to take your life. If you adore us as much as you claim, then allow us to take it for Stalwart." 

He raises his weapon and cries out. "For Stalwart!"</DefaultText>
