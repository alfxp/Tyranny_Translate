      <DefaultText>The soldier winces as he tries to stand tall. "I'm relieved to see my countrymen again, but give me a moment - I'm still weak from my wounds. Ashe's protection has kept me alive, but these [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] can be relentless when they want something." 

He glances up. "Afraid I don't recognize you, stranger." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm just a Stone Shield, but I was bound to serve [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url]'s daughter, Amelia." His voice falters. "It was my pride to fight at her side, and my great shame when Straydus Herodin's forces overpowered and captured our unit. The old Regent may be ten times as stubborn as his people, but he lacks none of their might."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Amelia didn't die on the field that day. We were both taken prisoner, but I was moved here and made to suffer. The [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] hit shortly after, and I assume stymied any effort to recover us. If Straydus isn't a fool, then he's keeping her alive as a hostage for some future negotiation ploy." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I have it from Ashe personally that he's felt a connection to his daughter." He frowns. "In fact, it's grown stronger for some reason. You have your orders, Fatebinder. The General demands that we take Sentinel Stand, recover Amelia, and put an end to these storms at last."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He blinks at you. "I don't know how they do things in [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s Court, but in the iron legion, we accept the Great General's instincts, especially when it comes to the well-being of his soldiers. You would do well to remember that." 

He gestures to Callias. "And if this one confirms that Amelia's unit was taken alive, I have no reason to doubt him." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Mattias had the others convinced that some old Stalwart artifact would help resist [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' storms. He planned on using it to let the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] pass the windwall and enter Sentinel Stand." He frowns. "Artifacts are a strange business, but the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] dedicated enough resources to the task of finding one that I would take it to heart." </DefaultText>

"In any case, we should have less trouble prying this stronghold from you than we did the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url]."

He spreads his hands in a conciliatory gesture. "Stand down." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Something in the soldier's mannerism changes. He turns to you with a look of respect. "Indeed he does. Were it not for Ashe, I would not be alive today. What can I do for you? I'm afraid you find me in poorer condition than I would normally present myself." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Artifacts are items of great power. They could be anything - a cloak pin, a pair of shoes, a fancy comb. Many of them resemble ordinary objects you might carry or wear, but they can do remarkable things."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Part of how the Regents maintained their dynasty was by way of inheritance. Houses Straydus, Sender, and Aspison amassed, over the centuries, a small trove of relics and guarded them fiercely down the generations. There's the magical sword the Dauntless, whomever the lead Regent was always wore a fancy helmet, and one of them owned an ever-burning lamp... among other things."

"Now, lots of those artifacts are scattered, but I'm certain that before the war, every thief in the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url] had some private fantasy about a heist on Sentinel Stand Keep."</DefaultText>
