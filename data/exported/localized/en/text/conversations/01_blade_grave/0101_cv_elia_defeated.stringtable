      <DefaultText>"I'm still alive? Shit. That wasn't part of the plan." The [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] captain grunts and squints up at you through a haze of pain. "I'm not telling you anything. My secrets... they come with me to the grave."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her eyes widen and she pulls back from you. "I... maybe there's something to your words. We've been fighting for so long, and all we know is this prolonged annihilation of our culture." She winces and holds her eyes shut. 

"Very well. If there's a chance for our people to live, I'll spend my last breaths cooperating."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Mattias was our captain during the war, but in Stalwart-to-come I would see him take on a higher authority." She sighs and looks up at the darkened sky. "Looks like those brighter days aren't for the likes of me." 

"Last I heard he was rounding up men in Trapper's Junction, but that was some time ago. He was due to leave by now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We were looking for the body of First Regent Aspison, who was presumed dead during the war. Instead we found records of his past movements. The final word on the matter is that he journeyed to a Breach in the Oldwalls and never returned."

She frowns to herself. "Not sure what he was doing in there, unless he wanted to unleash the Bane against the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] somehow. Dumb shit." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hm." Elia surveys her surroundings - a wasteland of scrap. "Unfortunately, I have no intention of going quietly or furthering your sick goals. So... fuck off!"

Snatching up a shard of rusted iron, Elia lashes out, taking several desperate and capable swipes at you. She doesn't stop this frenzied, relentless assault until you drive a blade through her chest and pin her corpse to the ground of her homeland.</DefaultText>

"When you think about it, I'll bet the Insignia could let an army stand against [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' windwall. You could even stride into Sentinel Stand like you were enjoying clear skies." </DefaultText>
