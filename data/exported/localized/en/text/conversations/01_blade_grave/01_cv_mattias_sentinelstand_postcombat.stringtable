      <DefaultText>Mattias takes a deep breath and leans on his sword. His hand pulls away from his side, covered in blood. "Thank you, Fatebinder. I know we wouldn't have gotten this far without your help."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The relief forces under my lead have the area surrounded, and the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] are now trapped between the storm and our spears. If they withdraw, they have to come through me."

"Even surrounded, the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] are still no easy prey. I can count on two hands the number of times I've watched a lone Iron Walker best whole squads of my men."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This place was our last line of defense - the holdfast no enemy has ever claimed. Until the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] came along, we had never known defeat on our own soil. And to this day, not even the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] have claimed our ancestral fortress."

Mattias looks at the crumbling walls, his face gleaming with pride. "In spite of everything these walls have come to represent - betrayal, cowardice - they are old Stalwart, through and through. Welcome to Sentinel Stand Keep."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Needless to say, I won't have that record broken on my watch." Mattias hefts his weapon and nods with quiet resolve.

"We can marvel at the wonders of construction and strategy later. Right now, we have a battle to win."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"When the winds die down or a path through the storm is found, things are going to get very bloody. We will give the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] no quarter... and we'll expect even less."

Mattias shrugs. "All the more reason to be thankful that we have you on our side to even the score."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] are making a press into Sentinel Stand Keep. They've advanced over the outer perimeter, but they can't cross the windwall, of course."

Mattias lets out a dry laugh. "That's the joke of it all - [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' storm stands in their way! Now that the Steadfast Insignia has been recovered, I'm not sure how long this... cyclone moat will last, but it's giving us time to rally and prepare."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This is the seat of power from which the noble families of Stalwart have ruled for centuries. It's also a holdfast of interlocking stone walls that just so happens," Mattias pauses, taken over by a wide grin, "to have warded off two score and four sieges in four centuries."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes, I can see why you'd be so proud of this place. Crumbling stone walls, a pervasive smell reminiscent of a dead Beastman, and the incessant noise of a magical storm."

"It's lovely."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We need to get across this bridge." He points north towards a stretch of ruined wall. "Before the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] cut us off, I sent a company of Sky Blades north to scale the old castle walls and shoot out the winch in case they tried to raise the bridge. No doubt my soldiers have run into some resistance, or else the way would be clear."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You know, this coalition you rumble about has the trappings of a decent plan." He smiles "Once you've got my Sky Blades in position, circle back this way and they'll make sure the bridge goes down. Then we can make our charge."</DefaultText>
