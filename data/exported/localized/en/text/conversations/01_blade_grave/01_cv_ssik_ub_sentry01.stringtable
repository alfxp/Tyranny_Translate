      <DefaultText>"Can it be? A figure approaches through the storm!" The Regent Sky Blade seems ready to approach and welcome you. Dawning realization comes to her expression as she hoists up her weapon in a stance of challenge. "Announce yourself, invader! We haven't sat in the eye of the storm this long to become slaves of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The... the Insignia!" The sentry lets out a startled yell. "Someone bearing the Regent's Insignia comes this way!" She squints to make you out in the storm. "Why have you come, stranger?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Mattias still lives... I suppose that is no surprise, but the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] are still together? Remarkable. We've been cut off from Stalwart proper for too long." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A friend?" She scratches the back of her neck. "I'm sure the Regent will want to see anyone brave enough to face the storm on his behalf. That must be some message." She nods. "The gate is just up ahead. Speak with the guard if you would have an audience."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The scout's voice diminishes to a whisper. "There are some who believe the Regent has lost his way. Please follow this path to the gates. You may be able to convince him to end this madness."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The war has left these poor clods behind. A year or more trapped in the same fortress? I'd sooner toss the Regent over the wall. No country is worth this." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What, you mean Amelia?" The guard gives you a puzzled look. "But she..." Before the sentry can complete the thought, she takes note of your brandished weapons.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Take us to Straydus Herodin!" Barik advances on the guard with a menacing air. "I don't want to hear any more of your petty threats or how much you love your country. Deliver us the serpent at the heart of this nest!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The soldier looks to her countryman and gives you a once over. "This madness isn't worth dying for... Not even the Regent would fault us for taking the chance to leave after all this time, would he?" Considering again, the soldier shakes her head and dashes for the opening in the windwall behind you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Sky Blade's weapon wavers in her hands and her face turns an unhealthy pallor. She seems equally poised to drop it and run or make a careless swing to open some distance between you two.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She furrows her brow and regains her bearing, advancing on you. "You think I haven't screamed into the storm before - that my desperation to see home again hasn't ripped from my throat when I least suspected?! You think I haven't breathed in my weight in rust and debris, and that my throat isn't as raw and parched as yours? Then come at me, and we'll see who roars the loudest!"</DefaultText>
