      <DefaultText>The lieutenant surveys the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] encampment with a dignified air. "Nicely done, nicely done. I didn't think you'd stand a chance without our help, but you're tougher than you look."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It would seem that Elia fled due north, which means that she's taken the real prize with her - the Stalwart artifact, or knowledge of it. Her fighting force might just be enough to punch through Jacomus and his men..." The thought clearly disturbs him. "We should chase her down before she has a chance."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The lieutenant surveys the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] encampment and chuckles to himself, clearly impressed.

      <DefaultText>"Ashe sent word to expect you. If he dispatched an outsider to help us in the field, that says something about his urgency to see these [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] conquered for good. I think we can both appreciate that his interest in seeing this matter resolved is of a personal nature." 

He catches himself. "I... apologize for that 'outsider' remark. Some of us aren't accustomed to working with anyone but the legion proper."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Looks like you took out most of their fighting force, though martial victory isn't the only reason we're here."

"Ashe says the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] are scavenging the [url=glossary:blade grave]Blade Grave[/url] for an old Stalwart artifact. I can think of nothing else that would help us breach Sentinel Stand, short of the Regent's timely death. It's a desperate gamble, but one that we can't risk paying off in the South's favor."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Under normal circumstances I might agree, but our proximity to Iron Hearth and Duskwatch make this a critical passage for a military force.
