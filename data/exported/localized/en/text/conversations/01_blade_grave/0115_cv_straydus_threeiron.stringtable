      <DefaultText>The gang boss edges closer to Herodin. "We don't have to kill each other, Regent. [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]The Voices of Nerat[/url] has a number of offers on the table, and many of them end with you enjoying a long life." He smiles. "Or some semblance of life." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Regent holds his weapon firm, but Jagged Remedy's words leave him troubled. "Stay back, I tell you! The Voices will have to seek his amusement elsewhere. I refuse to become a servant of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And haven't you served [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] by keeping this [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] alive, Regent?" Remedy laughs quietly to himself. "As much as I would take pleasure in killing you, please remember that I'm here to offer you alternatives." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You understand nothing of power, Regent. These stones belong to those with the strength to keep them. Right now, that isn't you." 

"Remember, we want him alive!" 

He snaps forward and attacks. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Regent." Jagged Remedy tips his head to Straydus. "I'm going to make this very simple for us both. You can join us in the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] and create a prosperous future in the Tiers, or... well, there isn't a second option. See how easy it can be? Try not to complicate matters by thinking about it for too long."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My elite soldiers, absorbed into [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url]'s slave army?" He chuckles, but there's a lining of unease to it. "The [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] will never control Sentinel Stand! This is the house of Regents - not the squatting den of your verminous gangs." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He trades a glance with his soldiers and nods, full of determination. "I would not subject my worst enemy to the mercy you offer. None of us will be coming quietly." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I did no such thing. The Voices needs the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] to stand a while longer. Your revenge can wait until our war with the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] is finished."</DefaultText>
