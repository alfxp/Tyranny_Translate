      <DefaultText>Eldian stands, staring at you as you tell him how Raetommon took the Magebane Helm. His voice breaks as he speaks. "With the helmet gone, there is nothing to stop the Bane from overwhelming us. We are not equipped to deal with a threat of such a magnitude. We have always relied on Magebane to protect us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I can't say I'm surprised about that, Fatebinder. Since Zdenya is here at [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s request, I was expecting someone to follow up on her. The artifact she created will finally give the Crossing a little bit of peace from the Bane and allow the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] to work uninterrupted."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Before Lethian brought that helmet to the crossing, the Bane held this land. No matter how many were put down, more emerged from the wall."

"I'll not pretend to know how it works, Fatebinder. 'Only a fool professes knowledge where he has no experience' is what my grandmother told me. I do know that once Lethian brought that helmet into the valley, the Bane problem all but disappeared."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This is about those rumors, isn't it? I wouldn't give much credence to them, Fatebinder. Everyone seems to think he killed those fishermen, but they went missing during a Bane attack some time ago. I feel the true answer is they were killed by some true monsters, not an imagined one. But without proper evidence, that's a hard case to argue."

      <DefaultText>Eldian stands here, his face showing a conflicting mess of fear and revulsion. "I hate coming in here," he says in a low voice. "But I had to make sure you were ok. I should have known it wouldn't be a problem for you."</DefaultText>

Though, I suppose you would have been fighting on their side, wouldn't you? But the Brotherhood overcame and now we're saddled with their continued 'leadership." He shrugs. "I suppose there are worse fates..."

      <DefaultText>"Thank you, Fatebinder. I cannot imagine what would have happened to us if you took the helmet from the Crossing. Without the constant fear of an attack by the Bane, everyone in town is so much more at ease."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Eldian sighs, and nods slowly. "As you will it, Fatebinder. After everything you have done for [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url], I will trust your judgment. 'The hero's path is hard fought and even harder walked.' my mother always said. I can't say I ever knew what she meant until now. If you say the helmet is better left in your hands, I believe you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Eldian nods thoughtfully. "I don't see the harm... With the Magebane Helm in place, it should be safe enough for you to enter. I will warn you to still keep an eye out. 'A smart man keeps both eyes open, a fool walks around with one shut.'" He holds out the Keystone and a piece of vellum. "This is a rubbing that Lethian gave me years ago... I have no clue what it's for, but she made it inside the Oldwalls so it's probably important."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"To what do I owe this visit? Have you come to see what became of the Crossing under the effect of your [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]?" He looks past you at the door to his house. "At least we don't have to deal with it inside." He shrugs.

"Not that I would dare suggest your decision was not a prudent one. I can't help think maybe somewhere else was more deserving, though..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"To what do I owe this visit? Based on what you did in [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url], I figured you would have already taken the throne from [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]! Everyone in the Tiers is talking about the Fatebinder and his infinite power! What can a small town like [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] hold for you now?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder! So good to see you again. Isn't this exciting? We're about to see the Master of the Forge show off her handiwork! That reminds me of something my mother used to say..." He trails off, looking at you.

"But look at me, yammering on like this. I should go check on Zdenya. Unless, of course, you need anything from me..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's empty, desolate, and swampy. People don't normally go there, which is why the Brotherhood use it for travel - there's less chance of running into someone on the road. If Raetommon is heading anywhere, he's likely to be using the March to get there."</DefaultText>
