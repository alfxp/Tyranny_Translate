      <DefaultText>"Not much, really. He's been acting on edge for a while now. Some people have said he cut a deal with the local authority to have his competition disappear!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Times have been tough all around since [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] became an occupied settlement. A lot of merchants will use any means they can to get a leg up on the competition, but working with the local garrison to take out your fellow merchants is against everything we Tiersmen stand for."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Basila looks at the seal for a few moments and shakes her head. "Can't say I recognize it, but I don't really get into affairs outside of [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] unless I have to. Harchiand Bronze might, though. He seems to be well-traveled."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh, it's you, Fatebinder!" Her face takes on a momentary look of dismay but she quickly recovers. "After your decision to enact an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] on [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url], business has been... shall we say 'sporadic?'" She smiles wanly. "So it is always good to have some business! Is there anything I can get for you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her face brightens and she smiles "Fatebinder! What a wonderful surprise! It's not every day one of my customers is someone whose power rivals that of even [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]! Please, tell me - is there anything I can get for you!"</DefaultText>
