      <DefaultText>"What brings you out where no one asked you to come? Are [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' dogs ready to be put down again? I won't surrender the Crossing no matter how many times you try to take it. We were hired to protect this city and we will continue to do so. No one else will have it!" He glances at his men, who have stopped to watch the conversation. With a start, they return to searching the bodies.

"Never mind." He waves a hand dismissively, "I don't care why you're here. My name is Raetommon, I am the leader of the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Speaking of which, what did Welby have to say?" He looks north where Welby stands, watching you both intently.

"Has she already started filling your mind with lies about me? She and I are going to have a chat soon. I can't have my First-Axe countermanding me at every turn. I know she wants my position..."</DefaultText>

He looks at his men, who stopped to watch the conversation. "You aren't done!" He flicks his hand at them and they return to their searching.

"It doesn't really matter why you're here. I don't care. I have more important things to worry about. In case you've forgotten me already, my name is Raetommon, I am First-Brother, leader of the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shoots a look to the north. "I had such high hopes for her as my First-Axe.

      <DefaultText>A striking man with a shock of bright blond hair stands here, observing some men searching bodies of slain [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] soldiers. He watches you approach, his angular features pulling into a look of disdain.

"Welby and I might not always agree, but that is one point we see eye-to-eye on. If you step out of line, we will both correct you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't appreciate your tone or the implications of what you're saying, Fatebinder." Raetommon's eyes are hard and his voice is flat. "This is a mere matter of principle - we performed a service and we were paid for that service."

"Don't try to glibly explain away a complex situation. This is our home. This is my home. I will have it, no one else. Now, if all you came here to do is insult me and mine, I would suggest you leave."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes we are, Fatebinder!" Raetommon's face breaks into a giant smile. "I am glad someone finally sees us for what we are. I am tired of people calling us mercenaries and sell-swords. So we get paid for what we do - we need to live!"</DefaultText>
