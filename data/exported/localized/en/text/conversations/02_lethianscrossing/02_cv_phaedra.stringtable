      <DefaultText>"We were living in the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url] when we heard about [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces moving to the Tiers, so we took that as our motivation to move." She laughs. "And I think we got out of there at just the right time!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I can't tell you too much." She looks contemplative. "Deya and I settled here after the recent upheaval. It's nice enough, but I don't think I'll ever get used to having those walls towering over us."

She looks at Deya. "What about you, dear?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They can all hang." Deya interrupts, her face showing the first bit of true emotion since the conversation started. "I have seen nothing but misery where they interfere. If you have the coin, they'll do anything! They're thieves and murderers and I can't wait to see them trampled." She emphasizes her words by spitting on the ground between her feet.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Deya!" Phaedra says, consoling her. "I'm sorry about that. I do my best to make our lives here as easy as I can, but there's only so much you can do to alleviate the pain of the past. I don't think that will ever be fixed..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't have an issue with them. Their curfew may be a bit strict and it gets hard to keep track of every rule they invent and all the regulations they've enacted. Otherwise, they've left us alone to live our lives."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Anything is better than having the Brotherhood!" Deya exclaims. "Give me a hundred rules for every Brotherhood member driven from this town!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I avoid them if at all possible." Phaedra's face sours when you mention them. "They are particularly brutal and everything sets them off. I would be much happier with someone else in charge."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Except the Brotherhood!" Deya adds. "I would rather twist under a scarlet boot for the rest of my life than have to look at a single member of the Brotherhood again."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A bright-faced woman greets you as you approach. "Welcome to [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url], wanderer! My name is Phaedra, and this is my beautiful wife Deya." She indicates the stone-faced blonde woman standing next to her, who holds up her hand in a quick greeting. "What brings you to town?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Any time, traveler!" Phaedra says happily. "If you need anything else, just let me know!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Deya shrugs, her expression never changing. "What is there to say? The town is all right, but living under the thumb of an occupying force makes it hard to truly relax." Phaedra puts her hand on Deya's shoulder and Deya sighs.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We traveled a bit with a couple of caravans, but nothing really seemed like home until I returned to [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]. You never realize how much you can miss a place until you've been away for a while." She wraps her arms around Deya and squeezes. "But I could live anywhere as long as this one is with me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's true that trade hasn't been as vibrant here recently, but I'm sure it's simply a temporary setback. The merchants will sing and dance for you, trying to convince you their suppliers are unaffected, but everyone is feeling it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I have faith the world will set itself right soon enough. People call me a fool, but I don't see the benefit in bemoaning your fate - you take what life hands you and make it work!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I've lived here most of my life, but honestly, I'm not sure there's much to say." She looks contemplative. "We're a center for trade and a waypoint for travelers. The walls are a little scary but you get used to them over time."

She looks at Deya. "What about you, dear?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Several years before [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' invasion, I moved away from [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]. Being the granddaughter of Lethian came with a responsibility I wasn't ready for. I met Deya in the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url] and decided to stay for a while."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"One of many I suspect, but I'm the only one anyone knows about. And before you ask - no, Eldian is not my father. Maybe you haven't heard, but my grandmother wasn't exactly the 'settling down' type."</DefaultText>
