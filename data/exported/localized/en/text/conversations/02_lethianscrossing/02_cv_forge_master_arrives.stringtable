      <DefaultText>"I'm sorry to interrupt you, Reeve Eldian, but I wanted to let you know that Forge Master Zdenya is ready to place the artifact. She and Lohara are finishing up at the forge."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My apologies. I assumed you knew. I guess what my mother said about making assumptions was right."

"Living in the shadow of the Oldwalls presents its own set of unique problems. We are frequently beset by Bane who escape, so the danger of an attack is always present. Now that [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] has stake in continued production by the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url], Zdenya was tasked with creating an artifact to protect us. She is here to deliver it and ensure it is properly placed."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Of course. She is most likely in the forge. I would take you there, but I must go to the spire to make sure everything is ready. I'll meet you both there when she is ready to place the artifact."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Did no one hire a [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] or two to inspect any old traps inside and cast a few wards on this place? Doesn't stop all the Bane, but smarter than nothing."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Don't know exactly why the Bane are attracted to magical activity, but we've seen it play out that way time and time again. All that [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] magic in town is probably too intriguing for those horrid monsters to ignore."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Do you have that many Bane in these Oldwalls? How do they get out? I thought the traps kept them from escaping."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We've sealed the entrance but the walls are worn and cracked and we can't keep patrols on them all day long - we don't have the resources. And the traps aren't always reliable. Some of them shatter if you get too close and then you're stuck dealing with a group of Bane instead of just one."

"Having the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] here has increased the chances of Bane attacks since they're drawn to magical power and that's all the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] use!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We've tried everything we can and the problem still persists. So Zdenya was asked to help out. That's why she's here."</DefaultText>
