      <DefaultText>Just as quickly as it came, his rage subsides and he smiles, but it doesn't quite reach his eyes. "But I might as well be yelling curses at the encroaching darkness for all the good it will do me to admonish you. You'll never leave Brotherhood affairs alone - never keep out of something you have no business in."

"Still, I will applaud you. I never expected you would get this far."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They told me to." Raetommon points at the glowing sphere and all of the stone structures built into the walls. "Once they start killing, they don't really discriminate. Flesh to rend is flesh to rend, you see..." He taps his helmet. "So this will ensure my safety."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A Havoc." Raetommon whispers the word in the throes of renewed ecstasy, a maniacal glint shining in his eyes that grows and ebbs in intensity as the light undulates over his face. "Let [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] send his forces. They won't win. I will raze [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] before I let him have it. Before I let you stop me." He looks at you, dangerously manic light in his eyes.

      <DefaultText>"I found a lost [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url]." A subdued glee punctuates his words. He seems strangely agitated, as if he wants to say all the words at once, but is also fighting with himself to keep from saying them. "He told me all about it. He sang such beautiful songs for me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He smiles, twisting to the side so the pocket is out of sight behind him. "Tricky, tricky, tricky... You are far too observant for your own good. By the Bane, you are a nuisance." He clucks his tongue at you.</DefaultText>

But I am the savior of the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url], and your accolades are dust to be trampled under my boot! I was going to watch you torn apart by the Bane, but I see now that it is my job. They want me to make you their first sacrifice!"

Raetommon lunges to attack.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Who knew when you were throwing me out of my home, taking my world from me, and sentencing me to a life in wilderness and these walls that you would be here to witness my triumph?"

"All I wanted was to keep [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] - to protect it, to keep it safe. I just want to be left alone."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My special [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] 'told' me everything. He was very knowledgeable about the Oldwalls in this particular region - and the rumors of a key that could unleash the Bane. He didn't want to tell me. I could tell he wanted [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] to have [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url], but I showed him how wrong that kind of thinking can be." He bites on the tip of his thumb, lost in thought.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Raetommon stands before a roiling ball of blue energy, his head seeming to bend and fold as light and shadow fight across his face. He wears an expression of pure ecstasy that immediately fades when the bridge retracts.

"Who interrupts me?" He turns and sees you, his expression now one of fury. "No!" His voice contains equal amounts of authority and petulance. "You cannot be here. This is for me and I will not have you ruin it."

"How did you make it all the way through? You don't know the secrets of the Oldwalls!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>One of his men hands him something small and green and he slips it into his pocket. "You are incredibly tenacious, I'll give you that. But that ends now. You do not belong here."

He stomps his foot, its dry slap echoing through the enormous room and reverberating back in a quick patter. "YOU DO NOT BELONG HERE!" His men involuntarily step back, away from his sudden rage.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Of course they won't!" Raetommon looks at you incredulously. "The Bane be praised, I have the helmet with their name in it! When I walked in wearing it, the prison shook. This will work! This is their will!" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>For a moment, you think he might have forgotten you were in the same room. Then he breaks his silence. "He mentioned something about crystals and the four points of a compass... but it escapes me now. Frankly, he was singing so loudly that it didn't seem important at the time."</DefaultText>

      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>Raetommon twiddles his fingers madly against the sides of his head as he tries to remember.

"It had to do with unlocking the Oldwalls. He found the clue in an archive somewhere. Said something about a compass..."

"Ah!" He fishes into his pocket and produces a torn scrap of vellum. "He drew me a diagram!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>He unfolds the scrap and looks at it with a frown. "Of course, this is useless. Torn. You can't read it if it's not all there" He shakes the scrap around. "Useless!"</DefaultText>

      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>Raetommon waves a hand dismissively at you. "Oh, we intercepted him carrying a stack of books. I don't even know where he was going. But who better than a [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] to ask about local history?"

He smiles, glancing to the side, subconsciously licking his upper lip. "He told me everything I needed to know to access this place."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>He mumbles to himself, scratching his head, looking back and forth between you and the scrap. Finally he relents, throwing it in your direction. 

"I can't read it anyway, so it's of no use to me. Take it, why don't you."</DefaultText>

      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>Raetommon's eyes narrow. "I am on the verge of having everything handed to me, only to watch you walk in with the intention of taking it from me. And you begrudge me my emotions? I think I will particularly enjoy watching you die." Raetommon's face grows red. "YOU WILL NOT TAKE THIS FROM ME!" he shouts. "[url=glossary:lethian's crossing]LETHIAN'S CROSSING[/url] IS MINE!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Raetommon sinks to his knees, coughing. He looks up at you, blood-shot eyes wet with tears.

"H-how?" The question is half-hearted and not really directed at you. "How could this happen?"</DefaultText>
