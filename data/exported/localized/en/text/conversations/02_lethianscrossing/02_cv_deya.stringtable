      <DefaultText>"My wife is dead!" She puts her face in her hands and sobs. "Poor Phaedra..." 

She pulls her hands away, a fierce passion in her eyes. "She was slain by the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url]! This cannot be allowed to stand! I demand a Fatebinder's justice!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Did you lose your mother to war? Maybe watch your father forced to dig his own grave?" She spits at you, her hands raised in phallic gestures.

"Heartless cad! You march south, carrying [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' banners, telling us it's for our own good - and yet you cannot protect us from common sell swords!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It was a younger man." Her words tremble with her sobs, "Sandro." She whispers the name in a lowered tone.

"He struck her dead and took the necklace. I was paralyzed... I froze and just... watched." Her eyes well up as more tears overtake her.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>After a moment she sighs and looks up, her eyes devoid of all emotion. "Well, I tried." She pouts. "I thought I had gotten away with it."
 
And in the space of a breath, she pulls a long metal pin from her hair, lunging at you with the improvised shiv.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Of course, I'm sure! I would recognize Sandro anywhere." The angry tone in her voice rises. 

"He and Phaedra were friends once. They had a falling out years ago over some trivial matter, he must still be angry about it. I think he took the necklace as a token. You know how these mercenary thugs are!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I thought that would have been obvious...? If I was the one who flagged you down, you'd be less likely to suspect I was the one who killed her.

      <DefaultText>"Fine. If Sandro didn't tell you, Phaedra was the granddaughter of Lethian. Which means she essentially owned [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url].

      <DefaultText>"Fair enough. I suppose I should just be happy you aren't going to turn me in. Here - at least have some rings for your trouble, Fatebinder."

      <DefaultText>"You know, that's a fine way to look at it. Here - take these rings for your trouble, Fatebinder. As you said, I'll have plenty more soon enough."

      <DefaultText>She scowls, cowed by your threat. "Look, I don't have many rings yet, but I can offer you something better. How would you like a discount with almost every merchant in town? The [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] and that Harchiand prat don't take well to intimidation, but the others I can persuade."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Surprised by the turn of events, and clearly feeling more arrogant than ever, she laughs loudly. The sound is harsh and grating. "Happy shopping, Fatebinder."

      <DefaultText>"If rings aren't enough, I'm sure I can persuade a few of the merchants in town to give you a discount. The [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] and Harchiand Bronze are above reproach, but the others I'm sure will agree."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fine. As you probably now know, Phaedra was the granddaughter of Lethian. Which means she essentially owned [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]. Every month, she would collect from the merchants and use the rings to maintain the market areas for their use."</DefaultText>
