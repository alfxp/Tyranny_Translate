      <DefaultText>"So, here's the Fatebinder." The man sniffs and crosses his arms, flexing his massive biceps. "We don't need anyone poking their nose in things that don't concern them. This is Tier Smasher's town and I will take care of it."

"I've got quotas to enforce. Whatever it is you want, make it quick." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Not a single problem here." He eyes you through a narrowed gaze. "Why? What have you heard?"

"Those Bronze mercenaries have been chewing on the settlers' food and we've had to knock a few skulls. They would make good shock troopers for the Chorus. Shame they won't surrender and conscript."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You did well to defeat those Brotherhood idiots who raided the Crossing. If we had more conscripts like you, maybe a few things would actually get done around here." He eyes his soldiers with silent judgment.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And what's worse, they're squatting in the Oldwalls!"

He spits a wad of phlegm on the ground. "At least the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] had the balls to meet us in open battle!"</DefaultText>

      <ID>10</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's right outside of [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]. It's wild, but close to the roads - perfect for an ambush. The [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url] dug their heels in years back, and not even the Chorus have been able to shake them free."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I just might..." Tier Smasher considers for a moment, then nods. "I'm getting reports of [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] soldiers moving through the region. My men spotted a group of them in a nearby village."

"This is unacceptable. This land belongs to [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] and I will not be the one that fails to keep it secure and brings wrath down on us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Destroy them. It will send a message to the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] that we are not to be trifled with. Free any captive villages you find - and convince them that they are safer in the Chorus."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I do. We still have the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] soldiers in the nearby village. This is unacceptable. This land belongs to [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] and I will not be the one that fails to keep it secure and brings wrath down on us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"With Eldian?" Tier Smasher waves dismissively at the door Eldian went through. "The old fool is angry that some of the settlers ended up dead while we were handling a dispute." He shrugs.

"I'd prefer just to kill him and be done with it, but Nerat wants to keep as many settlers as possible alive for potential conscription later. Can't argue with the logic, but Eldian is way beyond his fighting years."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Do I look like the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] keeper? I couldn't possibly care less about those foolish weapon-makers."

"If you want to know, talk to Eldian. He deals with all those worthless things." He points to the tier above you. "It's on the next tier up almost directly behind us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Most of the weapons have been lost, traded, or taken by other Chorus members. For a short time, though, it was fun to see the look on the faces of anyone we were up against who didn't know we suddenly had such great weapons."

"That fear alone made the price worth it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, I'm not particularly happy [url=lore:lc_ancient_threats]you forced the Chorus to clean up that mess."[/url]

"But, as one of the only survivors, it was much easier to achieve my current rank. It would have taken a lot more effort to kill all those bastards myself..." He laughs. "So I guess I can thank you for that much."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Pfffft!" Tier Smasher says dismissively. "My gang is perfectly capable of protecting [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] on their own." Then his face sobers.

"However... [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] will probably have my head if they find out the Helm is missing. I will speak to Eldian about it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He laughs. "That's the way to do it. None of this false-modesty shit! If you have the power, celebrate it. There's no need to pretend you're less than you really are!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I assume you're here to do more than just [url=lore:lc_pick_of_the_armory]take our iron weapons this time?[/url] Because I've got iron in abundance now, and I can think of a few places it could go." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You're the [url=lore:lc_pick_of_the_armory]high-minded smartass who follows the rules,[/url] aren't you? In my gang, there's only one rule, and I change it constantly. Don't cross the Chorus again and we should get along fine." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I suppose we had our fun in [url=lore:lc_guardians_due]combat games with the Brotherhood...[/url] just because we were at war didn't mean we couldn't enjoy ourselves. Earned my gang a few recruits out of it. But enough about the past." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hey, not my Bane and not my problem. [url=lore:lc_ancient_threats]You got the Disfavored to clean up that mess,[/url] so you know as much as I do. The last thing I need is a Scourge haunting my dreams." </DefaultText>
