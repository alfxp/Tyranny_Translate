      <DefaultText>Zdenya turns and approaches you, her lithe body moving fluidly as she walks. She stops before you, her stance solid and sure, but you see she is standing lightly on her feet, ready to move if necessary. She never takes her eyes off of you, but you know she is acutely aware of her surroundings.

"Fatebinder, may the fires of your forge never cool." She salutes you. "I had hoped our paths would cross."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What an odd question, Fatebinder. When you showed up in the forge, I thought you had been sent to check up on me. As my mission came directly from [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url], shouldn't you already know?"

"I was tasked with creating an artifact to protect the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] from the Bane. We have been delayed too often and lost too many of our own so it was decreed that something must be done. I created the Magebane Helm to keep the Bane at bay. Once the helm is in place its magic will keep the Bane locked away inside the Oldwalls."</DefaultText>

"For the time being, though, it will remain here, protecting the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url]. We have a job to do and cannot do it properly if we are constantly assaulted by outside forces."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I was trained at a young age to be a warrior but never felt any connection to that life - except when I was instructed how to repair my equipment. The fire spoke to me, it sang when I stoked it and told me where to swing my hammer to achieve the proper shape."

"I knew from that first moment that it would be my life. I apprenticed with the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] and focused exclusively on my craft. Soon my skills were superior to everyone else. I took risks with magics no one else dared to touch and created some of the most powerful artifacts ever to come from the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This forge is in the shadow of the Oldwalls in an area rich with iron. We have ample supply of raw material and the influence of ancient magics. It's an acceptable risk - and with the Helm in place, the Bane will no longer be an issue."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"As you wish, Fatebinder. I was just on my way to place the helmet. If you wouldn't mind, I'd like you to join us. The settlers have created a spot on the third tier. I will meet you there."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This is impressive. I could use the talents of the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] to supply an army to overthrow [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]. Would you consider joining us?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Talk of mutiny? From a Fatebinder? I would have thought one so deeply entrenched in [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' employ would know better. And as we both currently work for [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], it would not be to either of our benefits to speak of such things. I have seen the fruits of such endeavors lining the paths to the Archons' camps."

"I'm also afraid what you propose isn't as easy as you imagine. An artifact of such power can't simply be manufactured - it takes time and effort to make these items. Simple weapons and armor can be produced easily, but we are already providing those for the war. Regardless, protecting the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] is my top priority and right now that means getting Magebane set."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I must place the helmet before I do anything else. The settlers here have created a spot on the third tier for it and that is where I am headed."

"Please join me and we will talk further once I know Magebane is secure and working properly. While I'm loath to upset [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] unnecessarily and I am not convinced outright defiance is the correct solution, you are right in thinking something must be done."</DefaultText>
