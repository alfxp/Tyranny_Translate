      <DefaultText>"Our current orders are to garrison [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]. We are to secure the safety of the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url], the sanctity of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' laws, and the well-being of the settlers."

"And we're dealing with a gang of Free Cities mercenaries we need to club back to Setting-Sun." She coughs nervously. "Well, that's not the official order but you get the idea."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I believe so, and I don't like it." She shakes her head. "I had heard the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url] were using the Oldwalls as a hiding place, but I didn't believe it until now. There are items on these Brotherhood soldiers that came from inside the Oldwalls."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes, a man by the name of Gino has been pillaging supplies from the settlement for some time now. The last he was seen was out near Deserter's March. There is a sizable reward out for anyone who brings us proof of his demise."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Vintara straightens her posture. "We are the champions of justice in these lawless lands. Any lenience would be seen as weakness, surely you must know this?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>Vintara steps closer, her hand resting on the hilt of her sword, whispering so you can barely hear her. "Making wild and misleading accusations against a commanding officer is a punishable offense, Fatebinder. I would take care."</DefaultText>

      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>Vintara takes a step backward and drops her gaze, defeated. "You win, Fatebinder. I will exonerate Gino. I was decidedly uncomfortable with my orders in this matter anyway."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We were told to silence Gino, but to do it as quietly and indirectly as possible. Turning him into a wanted criminal seemed the best solution." She shakes her head, momentarily losing her composed standing. "I didn't know until just now what exactly he did to deserve it."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>

      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Really, Vintara? Is this information truly worth losing your life over?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I've already said too much." She stands back at attention, returning her gaze to the crowd.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Gino is dead, so you have nothing to fear. I just want to know what happened."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>Vintara's face shows obvious signs of relief. "Then the matter is closed, Fatebinder. The criminal is dead and that is all I need to know. Now, if you don't mind, I have a job to do." She stands at attention and resumes scanning the crowd.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <DefaultText>"Gino is dead. Here is proof of the deed."</DefaultText>

      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Thank you for your help in this matter, Fatebinder. You honor both me and the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]." She salutes you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What happened to having your soldiers handle it?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>Vintara tilts her head and considers you coolly. "Considering recent events, there are far more pressing problems that require my attention, Fatebinder. If you would rather I let the city fall to chaos as I concentrate my effort on one criminal, you will have to discuss that with my superiors."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>Vintara nods quickly and stands tall, saluting you. "Thank you, Fatebinder. You do the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] a distinct service."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Good day to you, Fatebinder." The soldier gives you a brief salute. She then stands at attention. "My name is Vintara. Welcome to [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Vintara's eyes darken. "We have an issue I could use your help with. I've gotten reports of [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] moving through the region. My scouts spotted a group of them conscripting settlers in a nearby village. They struck quickly and moved on, leaving a small force behind."

"Their presence in this land is unacceptable and I want them eliminated before [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] finds out they're here."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"They seem to have kept some villagers behind as hostages. Destroy the Chorus and free those people. We must do anything we can to weaken the Chorus presence in the Tiers and spread word of our good name."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Thank you! Every deed done in the name of the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] is a deed that helps solidify our hold in the hearts of the Tiersman."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Commander. It's been a while since I took leave at the Crossing. Glad to see you have everything in order." Barik nods. </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Barik. I haven't seen you since the march on Stalwart. It seems you've done well for yourself since then." She looks him up and down. 

"What happened to you out there?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The legion commander I respected would never slander the name of [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] this way. You are a disgrace to our noble forces." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I have followed Ashe to the end of Terratus itself. My last desire is to see the Great General humbled." 

Vintara quiets as she takes a thoughtful moment. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I picked up some extra baggage along the way. Nothing I can't handle."</DefaultText>

      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well, you look a mess. First chance you get, I want to see you in proper uniform. Understood?"

Without waiting for a response, she returns to attention.</DefaultText>

      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"My duty is to protect the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] who are here, not watch for the arrival of anyone new. I've given that task to Eldian to handle. It keeps him busy enough that he generally leaves me to do my duty in peace. Plus, it makes him feel more important than he actually is."

"If you want to know more about her arrival, speak with him. He went to the Forge to prepare." She points to the tier above you. "It's on the next tier up almost directly behind us."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>61</ID>
      <DefaultText>"With Eldian? He's upset how we handled a dispute between two of the settlers here. As much as he would prefer otherwise, Eldian has little say in how the Crossing is run now. [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] tasked me with keeping the area safe and that is what I intend to do - with or without Eldian's approval."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That depends on your point of view. If you’re one of these ring-counters, the situation has been just fine. The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] have and continue to fight off the Bane just as you commanded years ago.

      <DefaultText>"I already thanked you for your help. There is no need to rub salt into my still-bleeding wounds, Fatebinder. Without your support, things would not have gone as well for us." She folds her arms.

      <DefaultText>"There is another entrance into the Oldwalls in Twin Rivers. They are probably using that area as a base. I suggest you start there - but be cautious. There might be a number of [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url] in the area and if Raetommon is so crazy as to directly attack like this, there is no telling what will be waiting for you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>“I look forward to working together to secure Haven... though the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] iron you dispensed to the Chorus years ago would have been useful for that.” She stops, striking an apologetic tone. “It’s not my place to criticize, Fatebinder. I merely state a fact. You did make the right decisions when it mattered, which is why a [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] garrison, and not a disorganized mob, holds the peace here.”</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You made some tough calls the last time you were here. None of us were happy when you put [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] iron in the hands of Chorus soldiers." She pauses, a slight smile creeping across her face. "But the sight of you publicly flogging their commander after she tried to bribe you raised our morale for several span! More than a fair trade."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>“You’re a welcome sight for this garrison. You certainly had the foresight to separate us from the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url], years ago. Then, it was a matter of those mercenaries intruding upon our barracks. Now they want Haven itself. You were right then, and I trust that you will make the right calls again.”</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>“Manageable, thanks to you. The Bane are vicious fiends - they never tire and they never stop. Our men have their limits, even with General Ashe’s support. Had you not commanded the Chorus to ward off the monsters years ago, we would have been stretched too thin, and Lethian’s Crossing would have suffered.”</DefaultText>

      <ID>89</ID>
      <DefaultText>“I thank you, Fatebinder. And while I would like to see this matter put to rest now, we will have to bide our time.” She furrows her brow as she speaks. “The rebels must be preparing for something - Deserter’s March has become dense with Brotherhood activity in the last few weeks. Attempting to travel there now would be tactically unsound. Wait for the patrols to thin, and then begin your search.”</DefaultText>
