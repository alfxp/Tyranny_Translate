      <DefaultText>"Raetommon is our leader and First-Brother. If you need to talk to the person in charge, he's the one you want. But there's a good chance he'll be too busy or won't even want to talk to you. I recommend you talk to First-Axe Welby - she's going to be far more reasonable."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She shrugs. "No idea. Raetommon decided it was necessary, so we set it up. I thought it was weird, but you don't question Raetommon, not if you want an easy time in the Brotherhood."

"You'll have to speak to Will by the bridge over there to the west if you want to pass."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"[url=lore:lc_control]That was you?[/url] Then you might not want to stick around. Raetommon isn't very happy with you and he's become particularly short-tempered and violent lately. We've learned to do what he asks and worry about the consequences later."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her eyes widen a little and she puts up her hands. "Maybe that came out wrong, Fatebinder. We're gathering a toll on Raetommon's orders as payment for protecting the area. I don't collect the toll, Will does. I'm just the messenger."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Most people don't care to hear any more than that. They're more interested in talking their way out of the toll. Or threatening... I didn't think you wanted our whole history."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Recently, Raetommon decided we needed better organization and took over as the 'First-Brother' from our previous leader. And that's how the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url] in [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] became what they are today."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Up until we were [url=lore:lc_control]kicked out of Lethian's Crossing,[/url] it was home - the only home I ever really knew. Raetommon refuses to leave the area and as long as I can stay nearby, I will. It's not a perfect situation, but it's what I have to deal with."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She looks over her shoulder before continuing. "I think First-Axe Welby would make a much better leader, but right now most of the Brotherhood support Raetommon and what he does."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A young woman wearing battered bronze armor stands before you in the middle of the road.

      <DefaultText>"The [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url] has existed for hundreds of years, but in the Northern lands.

      <DefaultText>She sighs and shakes her head. "I shouldn't have said anything. I could get into a lot of trouble for talking about it. Let's just say that he's taken to using questionable tactics to get things done. There are a lot of us who think it's time for new leadership... Like First-Axe Welby."

"But it's not my place to talk about it. I'm simply here to tell people about the toll."</DefaultText>
