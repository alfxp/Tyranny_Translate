      <DefaultText>"I was just beginning to believe we were finally safe. But 'a celebration planned before its time will no doubt become a wake.'" Eldian shakes his head. "And without Zdenya, there's no chance of getting another helm."

"My friends, please, go back to your homes for now. The Fatebinder has taken care of the invaders."</DefaultText>

"Fatebinder, come speak to me before you leave [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]. I have some... let's say 'special supplies' you will be interested in seeing."</DefaultText>

"The [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url] have a camp near the Oldwalls at Twin Rivers and use Deserter's March as a travel route. Either one of these places would be a good place to start looking for Raetommon and Zdenya. Please find them."</DefaultText>

      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's empty, desolate, and swampy. People don't normally go there, which is why the Brotherhood use it for travel - there's less chance of running into someone on the road. If Raetommon is heading anywhere, he's likely to be using the March to get there."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There's another entrance to the Oldwalls there and I know the Brotherhood use the area as an outside base of operations. There are even rumors that they have been exploring the Oldwalls. If that's true, Raetommon is even more insane than people have been letting on!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"At the risk of sounding like Lord I Told You So, Archon of the Obvious, what in [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' name was the long term plan? They just leave the Magebane sitting out in the open? Unless they were willing to commit armed guards day and night, it's just asking for someone to steal it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well good, guess I'm not the only one who saw this as a disaster just waiting to unfold. But at least someone else stealing the Magebane means we can steal if from them and it won't be quite as wrong as if we stole it from the town. What? Why are you looking at me like that?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I hate to add a request upon a request, Fatebinder, but I would ask one more thing of you. The recent attack was horrific and there are a lot of folks that are in a bit of trouble now. Lohara lost some of her men in the attack – she was stretched thin before it all, so I’m sure she’s going to need all the help she can get. Some townsmen have also gone missing. I’ve no doubt your assistance could be useful to all of them, so if it wouldn't be too much trouble, please ask the townsfolk if they need your help." He makes a formal bow.

"I know we have no right to ask this of you, but I know you can help where no one else can."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The safety of this settlement is all that matters to me. I hope we're of similar minds on this, Fatebinder. Since you're clearly capable of handling threats, otherworldly or not, I'll see to it that the Oldwalls remain open to you. The passageway leading to the base of the Spire will be unsealed upon your return. If accessing it can help you in any way, please use it.”</DefaultText>
