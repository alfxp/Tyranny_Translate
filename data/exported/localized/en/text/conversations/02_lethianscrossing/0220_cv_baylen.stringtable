      <DefaultText>"Welcome! Welcome to the Sword or Sheath, traveler!" The robust, ruddy-faced man at the door greets you warmly. "Please come in and get a load off! I am the master of this wonderful establishment and, trust me on this one, the pleasure will be all yours! Baylen is the name, but all of my friends call me Bay!"

He winks and holds out his hand. "Would you like to be my friend?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"How can I be of service to you? Or, rather, how can my wonderful selection of entertainers be of service to you?" He makes a sweeping gesture drawing attention to the various men and women - and one Beastman - entertaining the happy patrons in the establishment.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Now, if it's your first time, I might suggest you start with Charitus." Baylen points at the blond man at the far side of the room. "He may not be the most adventurous sort, to be sure. But what he does, he is very good at. Straightforward and to the point, you can't go wrong with Charitus."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Baylen sighs and rolls his eyes lasciviously. "Oh, Evarista... If you're looking for time with an absolutely insatiable appetite, then you want to speak to Evarista. She won't want to stop even when you're done! And, as an added bonus, if you are tired and don't want to do any work, she'll do it all for you. Just lie back and let her do her job. You will not be disappointed."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Confidentially, I would watch out with Half-Mast." Baylen gestures at the Beastman by the fireplace. "Don't let him charge you too much - he's been told specifically to give people a discount. See, he may not necessarily satisfy you completely, but you will definitely get your money's worth. Look at all that fur. So much to grab on to. Only Beastman available in all the Tiers right here in the Sword or Sheath!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Used to be a contortionist, that one did" Baylen indicates the lithe, dark-skinned man at the back of the room. "If you're looking for someone to hit all the right spots, he's the one for you."

Baylen leans in and says conspiratorially, "If you're looking for a particularly good time, ask him to do the thing with his thumbs." He holds out his fists, thumbs up, and wiggles them around for you. "You won't be able to stand for three hours."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You want to try something a little more...shall we say...outside the norm - then sweet little Roxie is exactly who you're looking for." He points at the blonde entertainer dancing with Sheila.

"Beastman Style? Pulling the Shades? Splitting the River? Lifting the Banner? She will do it all and more. I've had more than one patron come out of her room crying with joy, having done things they never imagined." He blows Roxana a kiss and she mimes catching it and then places it somewhere up her dress, out of sight.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ah, Sheila. With that name, she was just destined to be a whore. Know what I mean?" He laughs and claps you on the back. "And if you want voluptuous, she's the lady for you. Curves, brother - curves. I'm a breast man myself, and you can't go wrong with Sheila."

He looks around and lowers his voice before continuing. "I know the entertainers like to tell patrons their signature moves, but if you hire her, make sure you try the Tidecaster's Flow. You'll thank me afterward."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ah, yes, Thallus. Thallus with the phallus." He glances at the rough-looking, muscular man speaking to a small redhead against the wall. "If you're looking for a something a little...shall we say...shit, why am I being discreet? He has an enormous dick! Seriously, it's gigantic. Trust me, you won't be asking 'Is it in?' with this one!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Now, if anyone knows about this establishment, it would be you, Fatebinder!" Baylen exclaims. "If not for your intervention during the Brotherhood's occupation of the Crossing, we wouldn't even exist!"

He smiles and winks. "Granted, I like to think we have improved conditions a little past conscripted prostitution. Now all of my entertainers set their own prices and I take a cut. It's good for us both!"</DefaultText>

      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Me?" Baylen's eyes widen with mock surprise. "That is hardly a story worth telling, Fatebinder. I was a simple, struggling merchant until you decided to establish this very brothel to control the Brotherhood's lustful desires. I may not be the best merchant, but I know an opportunity when I see it, so I volunteered to run the brothel."

"I can't sell trinkets to save my life! But people? Well, they sell themselves, don't they?" He laughs. "So life is good for simple old Baylen, I'll tell you that!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I let the entertainers set their fees and I take a flat fee off the top of every transaction. If they up their fee past a certain point, I take a bigger cut plus a percentage. This ensures my entertainers don't charge so much that people never return but don't charge so little that I don't make any rings."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It all depends on what you're looking for and who you want to play with." Baylen smiles, sweeping his hand about once again to encompass the room and its entertainers. "Simply approach whomever grabs your interest and work out the details with them."

"But if you find it's too hard to decide, I can tell you a little about each one. The master needs to know his entertainers intimately, of course."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Not to say I was always swimming in cream." He smiles and winks. "It was a rough start - especially with entertainers who were... for lack of a better word... forced to entertain our clients. But once people realized the money to be made, I was overwhelmed by requests to work here. You wouldn't believe the waiting-list to get a slot." He elbows your side jovially. "And a lot of people want a job, too!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Baylen puts an arm over your shoulder. "Now, I personally do not know how it could be possible, but if you find none of my sweeties is to your liking, I have a room available where you can... help yourself out." He nods knowingly.

"I am partial to that room myself! Just say the word and I will have to set up for you!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Right you are, Fatebinder!" Baylen motions for you to follow him. "The room is right over here. Take as long as you'd like, of course. I want to make sure you get your money's worth. There are all sorts of implements you are welcome to try out if the mood strikes you." He shrugs. "Actually, anything in that room is fair game if you're up for it! And all for 50 rings!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He drops his hand when he sees your face and stands up straight, only to immediately bow to you as formally as he can. "Fatebinder! What an immense pleasure it is to have you visit the Sword or Sheath!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'd say take your pick of my beauties, but I get the feeling you actually mean you want food and drink." Baylen smiles slyly. "I don't have much, because that's not really why people come here. But you're welcome to peruse the menu!"</DefaultText>
