      <DefaultText>"Not much, but what kind of example would that set? I'm a loyal citizen, but does that mean [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' soldiers can tell me how to run my store?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Sure, but the quartermaster is slow and sends the wrong stuff sometimes. Make that a lot of the time. It's usually faster to buy what we need right here in town."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You think I didn't already try that? Tharek's stuff is what we want. It's the best." He glares at Tharek, who's grinning. "Yeah, yeah, that's a compliment, you bastard."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Of course. Every merchant has a favorite customer or two." He glances over at Flick. "Flick isn't one of them."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Perfect decision! Even if I didn't agree with you - although I do - it had the added benefit of sticking it to the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url]. So this is a win for everyone!"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Certainly a fair ruling, but I worry that, instead of answering his prices, the thugs will just bludgeon Tharek and take his goods by force." Lantry shrugs with a frown. "But of course... if anything DOES happen to Tharek, it won't take a rigorous bout of investigation work to find the likely culprit."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Nice of you to stand up for this merchant's right to trade, but I'm certain this will just embolden others to take by force what they feel owed."

Eb chuckles, pounding her staff to the ground with a smile. "I do sort of hope they try something while I'm watching... all I need is an excuse... one little act so I can claim I'm defending someone else..."</DefaultText>

      <ID>71</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What is wrong with you? The Chorus already takes everything they want and hardly get any punishment except a smack on the hand. You just showed them they are justified in their actions!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Any wagers on how well this 'so long as they don't abuse it' clause will play out?" Lantry smile as he finishes writing down the exchange. "I think it's wise to keep the guards happy and content in the marketplace - it'll give them a vested interest in protecting the merchants from harm."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>74</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Consider the 'guards' are likely prone to stealing from the merchants in the first place, giving them a discount might actually cause them to pay for things they were planning to steal anyway." Eb shrugs with a smile. "Though I doubt your 'don't abuse it' directive is going to be remembered long after you leave town."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Wait a moment..." Lantry looks up from his task of taking dictation along a sheaf of parchment. "...they sounded almost agreeable to your decision! This is one for the Chronicle!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Alpha favors rot-smelling Chorus pack today. Because pack is snarling and vicious? Or is maybe because pack is best at sniveling and groveling?" She snorts, amused with herself.</DefaultText>

      <ID>81</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That sounds fair." Eb nods with smile. "They're getting a sensible discount in exchange for their services, and the merchant here should be thankful he's not paying recurring 'protections fees' to these thugs.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Kills-in-Shadow openly smiles - large and dangerous. "Good. Because Beastwoman enjoys punishing disobedient whelps. But whelps being disciplined do not seem so happy."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Frowning as he looks up for his writing, Lantry regards you with a puzzled look. "That's it?" With a shrug, he tucks his quill back into his sleeve. "And here I thought this would be a more lengthy entry into the Chronicle. So be it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She huffs, annoyed, red eyes roving her desired prey. "Run-scamper-flee little whelps. Leave Beastwoman's sight before Fatebinder gives humans as gift to Kills-in-Shadow."
