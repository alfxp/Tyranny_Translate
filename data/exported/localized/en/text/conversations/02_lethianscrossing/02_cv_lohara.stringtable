      <DefaultText>A muscular woman stands upright from her forge and turns to look at you, the light of the fire playing across her face, making her eyes dance dangerously.  A toothy smile breaks across her mouth, the only bright spot on her soot-stained face.

"Do you kill with your left hand or your right?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Thank you for finding our missing weapons, [Player Name]." A sigh of relief escapes her. "We almost had to leave the forge idle for the day on account of material shortages, and we've no desire to find out what will happen if we don't meet our quota."

"Add losing those weapons on top of it all and who knows what we'd be subjected to! We have to get everything repaired and back in the right hands!"

She attempts a good-natured laugh, but it falls flat.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I've a few orders I can't delay, but once I strike those out, I can start tinkering on something for you."

Lohara scratches her matted hair, leaving soot stains in her brown tufts. "I don't suppose I can ask another favor of you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Do you also answer questions with questions?" She flashes more pearly teeth and chuckles softly to herself. "It's a simple question, child. When you swing a tool to end another life, which hand do you use?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The gauntlet is the hardest piece of the panoply - and the most rewarding to work. So many scales of so many different sizes... then there's the rivets."

She slides her thumb and fingers together, shedding flecks of soot and iron dust. "I imagine you see a lot of battle in your... line of work. One gauntlet is invariably going to wear out before the other. My mind is always thinking on what will need repairs first. It's as simple as that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Draped in loose-fitting linens, a heavy canvas smock, and a layer of sweaty film, the middle-aged woman is a living display of soot stains, burns, and scar tissue. Beneath the soot on her head is skin that rarely sees the touch of the sun.

Her white teeth vanish behind a scowl. "Right. Or. Left."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Noted." She clears her throat and wipes her blackened hands on the canvas of her smock.

"I am Lohara, Master of Tempering, and Forgemaster of [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]. My tasks exceed the hours left in the day, but there is no harm in pausing my work if it means speaking with the Fatebinder."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Noted." She grips her belt and cinches it, rattling the picks, awls, and pliers that dangle from its various hooks.

      <DefaultText>"You have returned!" Lohara turns to face you, her body covered head to toe in charred hues, chest rising and falling under the strain of labored breathing.

"There is always more demand for iron than there is time in the day." She removes a set of heavy canvas gloves and balls her fists - the joints of her fingers crackling in unison.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ecstatic." Her voice is matter-of-fact, and a smile creeps in.

"The ritual of the forge links heart to hammer. My blood beats only when I strike my ingot, my forge runs too hot if my breath becomes too hurried - the bond is both fatiguing and exhilarating."</DefaultText>

      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I should hope so!" She laughs, her face blushing the color of molten metal.

"Better than being defiled and killed by brigands, poisoned by grain rot, or slain by childbirth. Would not a soldier wish to die in battle?"</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well, that and practice." She scowls.

"But yes, the rituals link the senses to the materials, and the body to the tools. My hand becomes a joint, the hammer the true end of my arm. I feel the heat of the forge as if it were the weather of the room. Under such circumstances, true focus can emerge."</DefaultText>

      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Can?" She lifts an eyebrow. "Most certainly. Will? Well, [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] invented queues for a reason."

She lets slip a sigh. "I have every Iron Walker and every [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] ringleader sending me bribes and flattery in hopes that I'll work off-schedule and make them some special this or one-of-a-kind that."</DefaultText>

      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Are any of them deserving..." She listlessly repeats your question, scowling to the side.

"My iron will outlive me, and probably outlive everyone alive today." Her voice becomes a hissed whisper. "But if my weaponry isn't used by famous hands, my name will be forgotten! So many of my works already litter the [url=glossary:blade grave]Blade Grave[/url]... ignored, abandoned."</DefaultText>

      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I get unreasonable demands every day, but it's not the volume, it's the purpose."

She lowers her voice to a near whisper and steps closer to you. "I do resent that [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' demands reduce our work to mere quotas! I should be allowed to customize my work for every soldier. Only apprentices have anything to learn from making the same size helmet again and again!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Wealth?!" Her voice becomes a roar. "You think I want rings? Sodding rings?!"

Her hands dart to her tool belt, both fists scooping clanking metal pieces. Flinging her hands open, she hurls two fistfuls of rings at you, copper and bronze loops clatter about your feet.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This is what I think of your offer." She slides her hand in a diagonal motion before her, emulating arousal of the male member. "Find some whore of an artisan willing to trade you the child of his art for chits of base metal!"</DefaultText>

      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But I speak out of turn." She clears her throat as she returns to her normal volume. "I suppose I'm just hungry for some variation in my work."

"How about this. If [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces and the folk at [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] have good things to say about you and your star is on the ascent, I'll make you something befitting your potential."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But first I need to know you're going somewhere. If I wanted my iron used by someone who will be forgotten to history... well, I could just let the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url] loot my forge if I wanted to do that!"

"When I've determined you are ready, we'll speak further."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't see much of it - only this," she points to the roof and walls of the forge. 

"Lethian and her merchant crew settled this area a while back. The brave fools built bridges over the Oldwalls and made themselves a crossroads trading post. Real pioneer spirit stuff."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The whole place might have been ignored by [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces, except somebody discovered there's iron everywhere - can't wash your clothes in the river without them coming out rust-tinged."

"So the iron made [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] important enough for [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] to want it for himself."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It made good sense to move some of us [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] here to [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] - easier to put us near the iron instead of shipping it over mountains. That, and this is a crossroads - we can resupply our allies faster than ever from our new workshop."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"For centuries, my guild has sought the union of magical and manual perfection. While others concern themselves with the arcane for the sake of inordinate power, we study it to overcome the traditional limits of our arts and crafts."

"The forge is our dominant concentration of study, but not all [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] work metal - some are weavers, carpenters, and one of our...odder members fancies himself a chef."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The wise and mighty [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] has been kind to our guild. He offered to put our weapons and armor in the hands of those who would change the world."

A broad smile overcomes her face. "And he has been true to his word! [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] iron has trampled the Tiers, and all that oppose [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces rest their heads on [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] spears!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No." She smiles and shakes her head. "But almost everyone asks. Relics of arcane power must grow into themselves - they are never made from nothing."

She points her finger in the air and smiles. "But what I CAN do is use my magic to swing my hammer with perfect precision, or work a cantrip to handle molten metal with my bare hands."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We can build artifacts of exceeding quality and refinement, but they must be used in great deeds to grow into relics of power."

      <DefaultText>"Why walk if you could pay porters to carry you?" She shakes her head with a huff. "We have ways to protect ourselves from those who would abuse us, but we study the arcane for purposes of building, not destroying - we leave that to others. They can take our implements and use them to sow chaos if they choose. I would rather take chaos and force order on it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Our most important rituals bind the crafter, tools, and materials into... one entity?" She cracks a nervous smile. "Close enough."

"In my own work, the forge-bind draws the whole of my senses to the edge of the blade I'm tempering. I can see the tiniest notch, or touch my finger to the blade and feel the razor sharpness without breaking my skin."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Such perfect execution of art has its costs, of course. Once heart and lungs become linked to flame and hammer - a dropped hammer could lead to a stopped heart.

"Most of our members die in the throes of their work, killed by a distraction or simple error." She blushes. "We lose a lot of apprentices."</DefaultText>

"But I'm no fool that I read too much into the kindness. We are a war resource, and exist only because we feed their insatiable need for quality iron."</DefaultText>

      <ID>66</ID>
      <DefaultText>She raises an eyebrow. "Our last iron delivery was light. The [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url] has been attacking [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] caravans for years and even though the ore is useless to them, they attack our porters just to spite us." Her face takes on a sour expression.

"I probably shouldn't mention this, but if you're going to be helping me, you deserve to know everything. There were some very important weapons being sent back to us hidden in that shipment. We need to repair them and get them back in the hands of the soldiers."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>67</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The attack took place at Deserter's March - not far from here. My hunch is that killing our porters and taking their rations was enough... they'd have no cause to lug a bunch of rocks back to their camp and I don't think they knew the weapons were there - at least I hope they didn't. Otherwise you'll need to figure out where they've camped... and I hear those fools are squatting in the Oldwalls!"</DefaultText>

      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I fear he may be dead, but I would welcome someone spying on the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url] to see if they're holding him - and, naturally, rescue him if he is still alive."

      <DefaultText>She raises her hammer to fling it away, then freezes and lowers it with a prolonged sigh.
