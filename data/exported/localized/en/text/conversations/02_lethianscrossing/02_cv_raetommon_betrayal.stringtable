      <DefaultText>Raetommon and Ceratha stand amidst dead bodies, staring each other down. Raetommon steps in to intimidate Ceratha, who refuses to move.

"Stand down, Ceratha. If you do not let me pass, I will kill you just as I have every other pile of shit in town."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I've got what I need and now it's time for me get to work. You will pay for your insolence, and [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] will pay for trying to take [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] from me. This town belongs to me and no one else will have it!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Absolutely not. If a few expendables had to die for me to get what I need, so be it. And it is clear to me that Welby's betrayal has infected you, too. Goodbye, Ceratha."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Plotting against you? Welby and I have done no such thing! We want what is best for the Brotherhood and [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]. This is our home! You have doomed innocents to a horrible death because your pride won't allow you to let the town go. You must stop!"

"I want to stay here as much as you do, but what you are doing is absolute madness! Give me that helmet!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Look who's here! But just a bit too late, aren't you?" Raetommon laughs. He holds a rope, the end of which is binding Zdenya's hands. Zdenya stares at Raetommon with an intense hatred. "Now that I have the Magebane and the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] Master, nothing can stop me from unleashing the Bane on [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Raetommon takes another step away from Zdenya before continuing. "With the Bane free, I will prove that the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url] are the only ones strong enough to protect [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]."

"Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a town to endanger so I can save it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Raetommon takes another step away from Zdenya before continuing. "With the Bane free, I will drive out the invaders that think this is their home and prove that the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url] are the only ones strong enough to protect [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]."

      <DefaultText>"You motherless cur!" Zdenya spits at him. Her clothes are splattered in blood and she works her hands, fighting against the bonds holding her.

"As soon as I free myself - and make no mistake, I will free myself - your blood will join your underling's on my armor. It will take more than a hammer to my head to take me down. Coward - using your men as a distraction! You know you are no match for me!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Before Raetommon can move, you scoop a rock from the ground and throw it at him. He tries to duck but isn't fast enough and the stone hits him right in the temple. He rocks back momentarily, a large gash appearing on his head.

Raetommon opens his mouth to speak, thinks better of it, and runs away to the south.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This is the Fatebinder who was instrumental in [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' conquest of the Tiers? How incompetent were your enemies?" He shrugs.

"If all you have is empty gestures, this is going to be easier than I thought!" He makes the same gesture back to you and runs away to the south.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Raetommon stares at you for a brief moment, as if he is expecting you to say something.

"Well, if that's all you have to say..." He shrugs and runs away to the south.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Zdenya growls and takes a step toward Raetommon, who jumps back and puts up his hands in front of him. You notice one of his eyes is black and his nose is bleeding in addition to the welt you caused on his temple with the rock.</DefaultText>
