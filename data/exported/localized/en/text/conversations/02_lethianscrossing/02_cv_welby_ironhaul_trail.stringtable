      <DefaultText>Welby laughs a little. "We're mercenaries - plain and simple. I'm not going to pretend like it's anything more. While it's true we have, in recent years, been a little more stationary than your typical crew, it doesn't change the fact that our services can be purchased if the price is right."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She sighs. "I wish I knew, Fatebinder. The First-Axe protects and consults with the First-Brother. I am supposed to be Raetommon's advisor, confidant, and guard."

"Lately, his behavior has become erratic. He's acting paranoid, manic, and distrustful."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My duty as First-Axe is to protect the First-Brother, but I am also sworn to protect the Brotherhood and if that means the removal of Raetommon, so be it. He has too many supporters in [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] right now to speak out against him."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Honestly, I couldn't speak to the cause. The stress of leadership? The battles with [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces? His night in the Oldwalls?" Welby shrugs.

"Does it matter? His behavior is endangering the Brotherhood and he must be stopped before we are destroyed. I fear people will be hurt by far more than a simple toll." She points south. "He is over there searching corpses, looking for information I know he's not going to find. He ambushed a patrol. he's going to anger an Archon. And for what? His pride!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I wouldn't waste time and resources on petty vendettas, that much I can tell you. I like battle and I like rings, and with the Brotherhood, we used to get both regularly."

"Now all we have is fear, suspicion, and blood. I want the disciplined regiment back, and I intend to have it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Raetommon will say it's because it's what we're due, and part of me is inclined to agree with him. But, if I were pressed, I would say his pride is hurt and he's lashing out. He can be such a child sometimes." She looks quickly at her guards.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A tall woman stands here, surveying the area from a small overlook. She glances at you and immediately goes back to watching her surroundings.

"Welcome to Ironhaul Trail, Fatebinder of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I hope Will didn't vex you too much. He's a good enough sort, he just enjoys his job a little more than he should." The hint of a smile plays across her lips.

"He thinks he's being sly, taking a cut of every toll, but he's told practically everyone what he's doing by now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"With all that running around, I wasn't sure you were ever going to make it over here."

"I haven't yet made up my mind if I should be offended you didn't speak to me first or happy I get the final word."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Did Raetommon have anything of note to tell you or is he still wasting his time scouring dead bodies for information he'll never find?" She looks south and sighs softly.

"I will admit he has led this group to some minor glories, but I fear how we will end up if something doesn't change."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She salutes you. "My name is Welby, First-Axe for the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url]. Though, I'm not sure that title matters anymore."

She pauses to gather her thoughts, then opens her mouth to continue. Instead, she exhales slowly and shakes her head. "Never mind. You needn't be burdened with my problems."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not going to take a job that doesn't seem right to me, but a ring's a ring and I will go where the money leads me."

"One point Raetommon and I will agree on is this - we did a job for [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] but we were not treated fairly. The Brotherhood is strong and we have the numbers. We will fight to the last man. I just don't agree with Raetommon's methods."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Just watch yourself around him. He hasn't seemed completely in control of his faculties lately. It's frightening to see what he's becoming."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText> Welby nods. "By your leave, Fatebinder. And be careful."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So is same for Beastwomen and humans, too. Like cycle of sun to darkness. Like crash of sea, ceaselessly churning. Better and tougher always replace old, weak, diseased or deranged."</DefaultText>

      <ID>86</ID>
      <DefaultText>She snuffs, greatly amused, chomping her teeth and salivating as she works herself up over the thought. 

"Beastmen do not give birth." She chuffs, studying Welby with darkly-gleaming red eyes. "Cannot be broodmothers. So how can Beastman be elder broodmother?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Welby stares at Kill-in-Shadow in confusion. "It's just an expression. I wouldn't even know first-hand if your tail hairs smell. And I'd rather not know."

"I'm just saying that we're not saints. If you have the money, we have the brawn."</DefaultText>

      <ID>89</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Raetommon's plans can doom our entire troop and I intend to prevent that from happening. I am loyal - not blindly devoted to someone intent on marching me off a cliff's edge."</DefaultText>

      <ID>90</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You're saying the course of action is simply to kill a leader when you don't approve of their methods? Is this to be the breakdown of all hierarchy, then? Are we all to become as Beasts?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>91</ID>
      <DefaultText>"If [url=glossary:prima]Prima[/url] can be killed, means [url=glossary:prima]Prima[/url] is not fit to lead tribe. Is not bad. Should still quickly devour slain [url=glossary:prima]Prima[/url]'s liver. While potent with remaining strength."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's not just that Raetommon is failing us as a leader... he's losing his sanity, and he has to be stopped. It's not simply our pride at stake here, it's innocent lives."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I need soldiers. Have you ever thought about uniting with others against [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>96</ID>
      <DefaultText>"While I am certainly open to the idea - a world without [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' oppressive rule is something I've dreamed of - Raetommon will not be. Past events have set him against anyone who isn't part of the Brotherhood. And recently, not even being a Brother is sufficient to avoid his ire."

"As long as he controls the Brotherhood, it will not even be a consideration."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>97</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Raetommon will try to sell you on our 'long and noble traditions,' like we're some kind of altruistic saints who can do no wrong, but that story is as old and smelly as Gramma Beastman's tail hairs."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We both know full-well that the rings that the Voices gave us were the only thing that bought our allegiance to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] when the Overlord turned an eye to the Crossing... Even if our thanks for helping was to be thrown from our homes." She contemplates you for a moment.

"Not that I hold any ill will toward you for it. Decisions have to be made and there's always someone who must pay the price. I just hope you realize some people don't like being asked to pay."</DefaultText>

      <ID>99</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The Voices made an offer to assure our cooperation and we took it. If I had known [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] would try to have us thrown out of our home afterward... Well, I probably would have still taken the rings, but I would have been a little more prepared for the inevitable conflict."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Honestly, I couldn't speak to the cause. The stress of leadership? The battles with [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces? His night in the Oldwalls?" She shrugs. "When you decided to remove the Brotherhood from the Crossing, it certainly set him off."

"Does it matter? His behavior is endangering the Brotherhood and he must be stopped before we are destroyed. I fear people will be hurt by far more than a simple toll."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What you're proposing is simply anarchy, which will achieve nothing but lead to more chaos. I am not perfect, but I know better than to throw a tantrum when I don't get my way. I assumed you knew this as well."

"Forget I said anything. If you do not intend to help, words are useless."</DefaultText>

      <ID>107</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I can't tell if you're baiting me, Fatebinder, or if this is more of your anarchic rhetoric. But the world has tried to stand against [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] and you can see where that got us. Still, nothing will get better if you don't take action - to more positively paraphrase you."</DefaultText>

      <ID>108</ID>
      <DefaultText>"While I appreciate you coming to me before speaking to Raetommon, you will need to be careful - he has, of late, been acting out of sorts and any perceived slight can become a problem for the one who offends him. Choose your words with him carefully."</DefaultText>

      <ID>110</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You chose to speak to the First-Axe before speaking to the actual First-Brother - the bodyguard before the leader. How could this mean anything but collusion and treason? I know I speak out of turn, but I only wish to warn you. Tread lightly around Raetommon."</DefaultText>
