      <DefaultText>The lanky man stops dancing when he catches your eyes and clasps his hands in front of him. He leans down and steps over his arms and pulls them up behind him. His shoulders make a small 'Pop!' and his hands are once again in front of him without him ever having pulled them apart. He smiles. "That is but a drop in a very large ocean." As he speaks, he pulls his right leg up, holding it vertically against his side in a standing split. "What can Philo do to loosen you up?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I used to perform as a contortionist." He lies prone on the floor, bringing his legs up over him to rest on his shoulders. Then he moves them from his shoulders to the ground in front of him and stands, slowly bringing himself back upright to gaze in your eyes. "That's the only thing you need to know about me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If my acrobatics aren't enough to pique your interest, then let me try to entice you with this." He holds up one of his hands and moves his thumb around, hypnotically. It reminds you of a snake. "Maybe you'd like to try Edging the Ruins. I guarantee it will put a smile on your face."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Of course. Anything you want." Philo moves his hips slowly and suggestively around as he speaks, emphasizing every rotation with a small thrust at you.</DefaultText>
