      <DefaultText>"There's not much to say, really." Galum muses quietly for a moment. "I am from the north and was traveling with a performing troupe when we were beset by bandits near [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]. I was injured and lost consciousness and when I came to, Mistress Sophia was nursing my wounds."

"The rest of the troupe died in the fight and I had nowhere to go, so the Mistress offered me a position. She knew my performing skills would come in handy. It's the best job I've ever had."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If you want the ground to move and feel the walls tumbling down, I'm the man for you. I will give you the 'Earthshaker's Delight' and - trust me - you will never want to hire another performer again."</DefaultText>
