      <DefaultText>A giant man with muttonchops and well-defined muscles dances before you. As you watch, his hands drop to his belt-line and he slowly caresses the front of his pants as he moves. When he finally speaks, he moves his hand, revealing an enormous bulge beneath the fabric. "You need something?" He smiles broadly. "Name's Thallus and if you like what you see, I'm ready to give you a closer look."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm big. I'm strong. I'm insatiable." Thallus stops and grins. "Is there any more you need to know?" He lets out a little laugh. "I was a lumberjack, if that's not too unbelievable. But I got tired of the work. Too much swinging, sweating, and pain, and not nearly enough pleasure. So I offered my services to Bay." He winks. "And when Bay had enough, he gave me a job."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Thallus flexes for you, making various poses before thrusting his hips at you. "If you want to spend some time with me, I'll unleash the Purple Scourge for you. Bay and I came up with the move and I believe you'll find it well worth your while."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Thallus plays with his shirt, pulling it up a little, exposing his stomach which is covered in hair. He winks at you. "Want to take a trip through the forest? There's one tree in particular I'll bet you'd like to see."</DefaultText>
