      <DefaultText>The Second-Brother regards you with a cautious expression. 

"The Fatebinder of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url], yes? Welcome to [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]. My name is Ring-Dropper Ceratha and I am Raetommon's Second Brother. What can I do for you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She sighs and considers her words for a bit before answering.

"He's...efficient." She grimaces. "He has become a little unstable lately but so far he has yet to do anything to make me really worry. He's more paranoid than normal since there have been sightings of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' scouts in the area, but I think anyone would feel threatened by that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She raises her chin as she speaks. "We're the largest and most battle-ready mercenary group in the Tiers. Lethian herself hired us to protect the settlers when she first founded the town and this group has been here ever since. It's our home!"

"[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces tried to remove us when they invaded, but we let them know we won't go quietly."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Scouts from [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' army have been seen nearby. We would be grateful to you if you could assist us in this matter. Eldian could tell you more - he's a local, and should be able to go into more detail."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"With Eldian? He's upset how the Brotherhood handled a dispute between two of the settlers here. As much as he would prefer otherwise, Eldian has little say in how the Crossing is run now. I sympathize with his predicament, but Raetommon has a very particular way of handling things. He tasked me with keeping the area safe and that is what I intend to do - with or without Eldian's approval."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I think that's a fantastic idea, but I have little say in anything final. As Raetommon's Second-Brother I can advise him but that's as far as it goes. Welby, as First-Axe, has more sway with Raetommon than I ever would."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ceratha laughs and turns red. "I earned the nick-name during the night of my first victory with the Brotherhood. We decided to celebrate and we drank - a lot. During the drinking and celebrating Raetommon showed up. I was so nervous - and drunk - seeing him that I tripped and all the rings I just earned scattered everywhere."</DefaultText>
