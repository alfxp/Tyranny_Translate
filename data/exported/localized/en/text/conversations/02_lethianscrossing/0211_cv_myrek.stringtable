      <DefaultText>"If that were possible, Raetommon would already have found a way. But you are welcome to try - no matter how futile the effort."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Myrek's eyes widen at your words. "I can see now why Raetommon hates you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Raetommon sent me here to retrieve any loyal soldiers I can find. I assumed that would include Locke, but apparently I was wrong. The penalty for disloyalty is death."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So, if Raetommon sent you, you know where he is."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>14</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I don't ask. I just do. If you need to know why he wanted it, he will have to tell you. And he doesn't want to talk to you."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>"They must have been traitors to the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url]." Myrek says this more to himself than to you. "Otherwise, Raetommon wouldn't have killed them. That has to be the reason."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>16</ID>

      <DefaultText>"No." Myrek expression is resolute. "I do not trust you or your motivations. I won't tell you."</DefaultText>

      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>Myrek looks at you suspiciously. "Raetommon went into the Oldwalls at Twin Rivers - and before you ask, I don't know what he's doing there. But even if you follow him, you won't find him because you don't have the Keystone."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Because you're going to tell me where he is or you're going to bleed out on the ground. Your choice."</DefaultText>

      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>Myrek takes an involuntary step away from you. "Is violence always how you get what you want?" His shoulders sag. "Raetommon went to Twin Rivers. And before you ask, I don't know what he's doing there. But even if you follow him, you won't find him because you don't have the Keystone."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If the men Raetommon kills are traitors, the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url] must have a lot of them."</DefaultText>

      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yes!" Myrek makes the declaration vehemently. "I know everything he does will be good for everyone. We just have to trust him!"</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>Myrek purses his lips, his eyes moving back and forth and he considers your words. "You might have a point, Fatebinder, but I still don't trust your motives. I am not going to turn over the leader of the Brotherhood on speculation."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Locke thinks Raetommon is acting in his own self-interest. He wants you to see Raetommon for who he really is."</DefaultText>

      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No! He's doing what's best for [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]!" Myrek looks conflicted. "Isn't he?" He shakes his head.

"Yes! He must be..." He trails off, confused.</DefaultText>

      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>Myrek looks like you struck him across the face. "But...he did what was necessary! It's for the greater good!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You've gotten all the information out of me that I will give, Fatebinder. Just know that without it, you will never find Raetommon."</DefaultText>

      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No! That can't be true!" Myrek's eyes are conflicted. He looks at Locke. "Can it? He said what he was doing would lead us to glory and we would be vindicated. He can't have lied to me. I just can't believe that." Myrek looks down. "Because if that's true..." He looks at you again, the certainty no longer so strong on his face.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We are in the middle of war, Fatebinder. People die." There is defiance in Myrek's eyes, but no conviction behind his statement. "Perhaps they betrayed him. Perhaps they tried to mutiny. We don't know his true motivations." He looks to the side and you can tell he doesn't really believe his own words.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Even if I were to believe you, there is nothing that can be done. He's gone and for all we know it's too late." All sense of conviction is gone from his words. He looks at Locke. "What have I done?"</DefaultText>
