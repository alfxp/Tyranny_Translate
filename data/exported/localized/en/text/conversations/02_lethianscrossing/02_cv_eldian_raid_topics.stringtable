      <DefaultText>"Not well, I'm afraid. There's been some tension here and there with the Brotherhood, but by and large they've never attacked people in the settlement. They actually had their fair share of admirers here, believe it or not."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We've at least a dozen dead, more wounded. Most folks stayed inside and got out of harm's way, but everyone's rattled." He gingerly rubs a bandage wrapped around his hand, wincing as he does.  

"The attack didn't make a lick of sense - who's to say that Raetommon might not return for more?""</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Truth be told, Fatebinder, I'm much more concerned about that helmet than Brotherhood on a rampage. It's true we survived here for a long time without magical protection, but that situation can change as soon as you'd blink."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He points to a dark, scarred patch of skin on his neck. "I got this many years ago. Thankfully, Bane attacks were few and far between then."

He pulls back his sleeve to reveal some tightly-wound bandages on his forearm and bicep. "These I got in separate attacks in the last two months. Something is driving the Bane out of those Oldwalls... why do you think Zdenya was ordered to come here and deliver that fancy helmet?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He snorts, frustration evident in his voice. "I think it's safer to say that Raetommon attacked... though perhaps they're one and the same. I've been around long enough to know how to spot the weed that'll strangle your crops. That man has always carried a bit of poison inside him, even before [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] kicked the Brotherhood out."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Raetommon once burned a village to the ground to kill a rival that was hiding there with the help of some sympathetic folks. He said that the villagers raised arms against them, but that's a load of pig shit. He did it because he was obsessed with getting vengeance and never lets go of his obsessions. This rival wronged him before, so he left no stone unturned until she was dust in the ground, consequences be damned."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Whatever fool notion compelled him to order his men to come to [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] and steal Magebane - I guarantee you - has everything to do with that obsessiveness. He hasn't changed all these years. There's something big he wants, rest assured, and right now we're all in his way."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Brotherhood doesn't like to stay in one place for too long, so I can't easily point you to one location, I'm afraid. Haven's full of thick, forested caravan routes and river crossings. They like to make themselves at home at places like that for days at a time. And then, just when word reaches travelers of their whereabouts, they pick up and move on. Crafty fellows."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Interesting question." Eldian scratches his beard, squinting his eyes in thought.

"Truth be told, the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] and the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url] never really got along. The ironworkers think of themselves as artisans and see Brotherhood soldiers as dim-witted thugs that aren't worthy of their fancy swords."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Brotherhood, for their part, see the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] as docile servants of the Overlord, happy to trade their dignity for regular meals and a steam-filled prison they call the Forge."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't know if Raetommon aimed to take Zdenya. Quite frankly, she's just as likely to cave his head in with her hammer on any given day." He chuckles at the thought.

"Whether he planned it or not, giving the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] their comeuppance is probably something he's wanted for years." </DefaultText>

      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I've heard rumblings about that. Word is that their leader is a paranoid sort. He sees conspiracy and betrayal at every turn. I've seen a few of his lieutenants come and go. Pretty sure they're not all falling in battle."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Tell me, if that's the sort of man you're following, how long do you think it'll be before someone else tries to stake a claim? I've known some Brotherhood men and women in my time. I'd never call them wholesome but not all of them are arsewipes. This move by Raetommon is going to rub some of his folks the wrong way."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Any idea where Raetommon might have taken Zdenya?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I doubt Raetommon would continue that routine with Zdenya and Magebane in tow, though. Rumor has it that he sometimes moves through the Oldwalls, which, on account of it being absolutely daft, probably means that it's true."

He shrugs. "This is all a long-winded way for me to say that I'm in the dark here. Sorry, Fatebinder."
