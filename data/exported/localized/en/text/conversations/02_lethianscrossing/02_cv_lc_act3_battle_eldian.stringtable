      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder, thank you for your help - and I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you for more. The people of [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] are in danger and you are the only one we can count on right now."</DefaultText>

Though today's battle makes me worry for the rest of the tiers.
