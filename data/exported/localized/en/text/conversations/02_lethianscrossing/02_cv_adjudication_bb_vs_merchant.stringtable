      <DefaultText>"Sorry to cause a disturbance, Fatebinder. Just making a 'point' to my friend here about harassing me for rings." He chuckles.

      <DefaultText>"I can see how it might look, but that's how it's done around here. Sometimes, anyway."

He folds his arms. "It doesn't matter since that's not the issue and it didn't work, anyway. Krassner can keep the rings he extorted from the others, but he's not getting a single one from me. I hired him to do something and he didn't do it. End of story."</DefaultText>
