      <DefaultText>"Well, not on purpose, I guess. But he did put us into a lot of danger, so it's sort of the same thing. I bet there's a law against that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Felix was going to make an axe for each of us in return. I couldn't pass it up - a [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] axe costs a lot of rings, normally."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hey, [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] magic is just as dangerous, you know. It's not my fault the most reliable, stable materials happen to be found near the Oldwalls!"

      <DefaultText>"The best materials are found near the Oldwalls, and good material is hard to come by. There's no way I could do it all myself - I'd never get any forging done, and my master is very particular about meeting production quotas."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Um, yes, of course, Fatebinder, but surely there's room for some flexibility in that law. After all, I'm sure that [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] would want us to produce only the best arms and armor for his armies...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It was a fair trade for their service. Plus, it's not like forging items using those materials is perfectly safe, either. One error and you're a pile of ash on the floor."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm not one of the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url], so I know getting my hands on genuine [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] items is damn hard. Naturally, I jumped at the chance to do the job for Felix. I mean, it was just gathering materials."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Felix, you are guilty of circumventing [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' law. Your behavior is unbecoming of one of the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url], and you are hereby stripped of your status. Report this to your master."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So... make something for these two louts and he gets to live? That sounds fair. I think the whole 'go into the Oldwalls and we kill you' law is pretty absurd, so I think it wise to offer a more reasonable sentence."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes, I've done similar jobs. This is the first one that's taken me anywhere near the Oldwalls, though. I figured Felix knew what he was about, though, or that he'd gotten the go-ahead from his master."</DefaultText>
