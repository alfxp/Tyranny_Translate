      <DefaultText>Locke looks at you cautiously as you approach and holds up his hands. "Fatebinder, I know the recent events in [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] were unusual as well as regrettable."

"In light of Raetommon's actions forcing your hand, we will overlook all the Brotherhood blood on your sword."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Right now, the important thing is to convince Myrek that Raetommon doesn't have anyone's best interests in mind and his insatiable need to be the victor is going to kill us all."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The shipment is fortuitous, Fatebinder. You have certainly earned favor within the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url] with this gift."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It sounds ridiculous to me, too, but she won't listen to me. Let her join and let her die. You won't have a problem anymore."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Locke stares at you for a while before speaking. "Fine. She will have her chance, but we won't go easy on her. Tell her to meet Welby in Twin Rivers. Everyone needs their orders before they're allowed to fight."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Locke shakes his head. "I had hoped to avoid the bloodshed... He didn't need to die, but there was no other way this could have ended. Raetommon needs to pay for what he has done to his people."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>95</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No. We might be mercenaries, but we aren't murderers. Myrek is a loyalist, so he follows Raetommon's orders without question, no matter how crazy they are. Myrek isn't an evil person, he just has a hard time thinking for himself and is easily manipulated."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Maybe you can talk some sense into him. If he isn't careful, he's going to get a lot more people killed. There is nothing more terrifying than blind faith in flawed leaders."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If I only knew, I might have been able to prevent this. Raetommon has become increasingly unstable since [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces took [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] from him."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I was reporting every sighting to Raetommon, telling him it was no longer safe to stay here with all the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] around, but Raetommon wouldn't hear of leaving.

      <DefaultText>"The last time I heard anything from Raetommon, he was talking about taking extreme measures to keep [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] out of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' hands." Locke shakes his head. "With the theft of the Magebane helmet I think Raetommon is planning on using the Bane. I don't know how and I'm terrified to see what he will do."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Locke makes a sharp gasp when you take the stone from Myrek's body. "That's one of the Keystones Raetommon uses to enter the Oldwalls at Twin Rivers! If Myrek has a keystone, Raetommon must be there."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I have no clue. Until the issue with Raetommon is dealt with, I know of nowhere I can go. For now, we will remain here and out of Raetommon's gaze. If we stay quiet my hope is he will forget about us."</DefaultText>

      <ID>116</ID>
      <DefaultText>He reaches into a pouch and produces a small stone with a symbol carved on it. "This is my token. Give it to Kalea and tell her Welby will allow her into camp as long as she has that with her. That is all I will do - the rest is up to her."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I really don't know. I imagined that we'd be here much longer. Maybe I'll return to my home in [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] and leave the Brotherhood. The world is getting a little too dangerous for my taste."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Locke's eyes widen and a smile cracks his face. "Are you serious? That's the best news I've heard in a long time!" He shakes his head. "Wow. Now the whole world is open to me..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He takes up his weapon in a shaking hand. "But I was willing to talk! I was willing to..." 

He flinches as a couple of soldiers flee the area, hitching up their trousers as they go. 

"Come back, you cowards! Damn it! Why aren't any sane people in charge of this war?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Perhaps he means to better arm the Brotherhood. We can always use quality weapons, so getting a hold of [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] iron would be an exciting propsect. With [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces on the move, that would be welcome."</DefaultText>
