      <DefaultText>A hunched, defeated looking man sees you approach and stands up quickly. His eyes wild with hunger, his skin peppered with sores and dirt collected from sleeping on the ground. He calls out to you with a weak and trembling voice. "I know why you're here." His voice cracks as he begins to plead. "You mustn't believe the lies they've told you - I've done nothing wrong!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>In his terror, Gino's words rush together and you almost can't understand what he's saying. "I saw them burying bodies - it was outside the Oldwalls in Twin Rivers. In the undergrowth. I was there to see if I could get some fish from the river and saw them! The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] were burying bodies. They want me dead for seeing the bodies!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm a fisherman so I come out here all the time. The best catch in the area is at the fork in Twin Rivers - and it's a little off the beaten path. It's also the place the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] stash bodies they don't want found!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm sorry you had to see that," Gino does a quick and apologetic bow. "My brother Alagan normally runs the stall, but he's out getting supplies right now so I've been forced to endure the public while I watch over things. Alagan should return shortly."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Gino's eyes darken momentarily and he blinks, looking around briefly before he answers. "I am simply a fisherman. Making enemies is out of my reach. I'm certainly not interesting enough to gain anyone's attention." He sighs.

"But I'm sure someone with your authority could get to the root of this. If you could find the person responsible for spreading these lies, you would have a hefty discount at my store."</DefaultText>
