      <DefaultText>Svansen attentively stacks pieces of iron carefully inside a crate. He notices you approach and dusts off his hands. "A Fatebinder, honored to be graced with your presence."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Svansen scratches the top of his head for a moment. "No, at least I don't think I am. Though I feel I may have a kindred spirit for the craft."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't think I can." He stares off momentarily as if to search his own mind but finds nothing. "I don't entirely understand it, but they say I lost my memory in an accident a few years ago and now I don't have whatever it is I would need to become one."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Svansen's expression darkens. "No, I haven't pressed the question. I guess it doesn't really matter anymore."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Svansen smiles wide. "All kinds of things! Sometimes I haul iron, sometimes I run missives. I've been told this has always been my job, and I appreciate staying busy."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] Merchant is faced away from the conversation and overhears your exchange and turns to you. "If it isn't the Fatebinder of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]. Welcome to [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]!" He motions to Svansen. "Finish your work and then you can continue speaking with the Fatebinder." Svansen nods eagerly and gets back to piling the iron.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Once Svansen's back is turned, the merchant casts a worried look towards you. "[url=lore:lc_redanvil]I don't wish to question your judgment[/url] and I am grateful of the help, but it's just..." The two of you observe the docile naivet√© of Svansen as he examines a piece of rat shit on the ground near the crate. "It's just a little unsettling how a man can become a child again. I don't know what I'd do if I suddenly forgot everything that made me who I am."</DefaultText>
