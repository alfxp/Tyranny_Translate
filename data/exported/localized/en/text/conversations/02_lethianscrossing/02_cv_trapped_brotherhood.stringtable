      <DefaultText>He winces again after discovering a new wound in his leg. "We entered into the Oldwalls with Raetommon, but we were quickly separated and our ranks broken by the Bane. Raetommon pressed forward - told us to fight back the bane and regroup once they had been defeated." His face begins to drain of color. "But they never stopped, wave after wave for hours...

The mercenary nods to his companions and they grab what they can and begin to shuffle off. "We'll be heading back to camp. We've had enough of this shit hole for one day - Raetommon can rot here for all I care."</DefaultText>
