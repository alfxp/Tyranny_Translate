      <DefaultText>"Good, good. Now the people of [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] have one less thing they must worry about. Fatebinder, will you go inside and see what effect the Helm is having on the Bane?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm afraid that's exactly what I'm doing, Fatebinder. After all the deaths caused by the Bane, no one in the Crossing is willing to set foot inside. You are the only one who can possibly take on the Bane if the helm isn't working."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Eldian's mouth drops open. "Oh. I didn't know that would be a requirement, Fatebinder. If payment for assisting the helpless is what you need, then you will get it." He hands you his ring belt. "Take it all, I just need to know my citizens are safe."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' law states that no one is allowed to enter the Oldwalls. But if no one goes inside, we will never know if the helmet is working. I will do this for you."</DefaultText>
