      <DefaultText>Her expression turns from one of defiance to that of a bashful child. "I spoke with Locke but he turned me away because he said he had something else more important to deal with."

"I knew I could convince him to let me join, but by the time I gathered my courage up to speak with him again, a different group of Brotherhood soldiers turned up.

      <DefaultText>She rubs her brow in tight, frustrated circles. "Here I thought that I had something figured out, but maybe Kallion was right all along." 

"I'll go back to him. When the world burns, I suppose you could be in worse company than your family. Besides, he's not exactly handy with a blade. Someone needs to keep him away from the front lines. I will go - for now."</DefaultText>
