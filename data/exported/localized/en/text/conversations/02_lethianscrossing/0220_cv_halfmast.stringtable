      <DefaultText>The rough-looking Beastman grunts at you. Although it seems to have been recently brushed, his fur is matted in clumps and he occasionally scratches himself, gingerly sniffing his claw when he finishes. The small loincloth around his waist does little to cover him and your gaze moves of its own accord to stare at what's between his legs. He smiles. "Human like Half-Mast?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Half-Mast swings his hips, causing his loincloth to swing up and down. There is a flash here and there of the flesh underneath. "Human come back for fun?"</DefaultText>
