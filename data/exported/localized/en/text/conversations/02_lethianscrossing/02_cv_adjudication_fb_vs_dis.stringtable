      <DefaultText>The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] soldier scoffs. "'Travesty?' 'Beseech?' 'Atrocity?' What's with the sudden rise in station, Cressina? Are we trying to impress the Fatebinder?"

"You're a glorified slave." He punctuates every sentence by counting them off on his fingers. "You haul iron. You stoke the fires in the forge. You clean up after the real [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url]. No one cares about you, so don't bother the Fatebinder with your meaningless problems."</DefaultText>

You're as much a slave as I am, but at least I am able to leave if I want. My 'slavery' leads to enormous power. And my problems aren't meaningless - anyone can ask the Fatebinder to adjudicate their problems. You're just afraid you're going to be found at fault."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My Beastman! Do you know how long it takes to train a Beastman? I know her name is a little unusual, but she was... slower than the typical beast and training took a little longer than it usually does and she got in the way a lot.

      <DefaultText>"When everyone came into view, I saw Out-of-the-Way standing over someone with her claws raised and the rest of the onlookers cowering away from her.

      <DefaultText>"Not as eager to tell the gory details are you?" He shakes his head.

"There isn't a townsperson. At least, not anymore. I wasn't fast enough to respond to the disturbance. Out-of-the-Way had already killed and gutted him by the time I arrived. Of course, I didn't know he was already dead when I ran her through, but that wouldn't have changed anything. She was crazed and I did what I could to stop her from hurting anyone else."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The truth of their statements is irrelevant to what happened! You didn't see it either, genius! You don't know what happened any more than I do!"
