      <DefaultText>"Greetings and salutations!" The jolly merchant greets you with a smile and a clap on the shoulder. "And welcome to [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]! Home of the best merchant in the entirety of the Tiers!" He pauses and winks. "That would be me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Mm, let's take a look, shall we?" Harchiand takes the seal and turns it over. When he spots the insignia, he quickly deposits it back in your hand and wipes his palms clean. 

"Where did you get that?!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"First things first." Harchiand clears his throat. "This will come at a price. If something unfortunate took place, and my connection were traced back to me, the consequences would be... costly."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If you breathe a word of this to anyone, I will denounce you for the liar that you are, but..." He looks around to make sure there are no settlers close enough to overhear what is being said.

"I received instructions from Fifth Eye to use Hand-Over-Quill to deliver iron weapons to [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url] Citadel. I don't question my orders, I just follow through. I don't know anything else - and that's the truth!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He studies you a moment before his posture deflates. "No, I suppose not. You can make my life far more difficult in the long run, can't you?" </DefaultText>

      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Oh, there have been several over the years - and they've thrived or struggled in this new age of law." He counts off his fingers. "There were the Jade Marmots, the Lace Fringe, the Linked Rings, and of course the Hand-Over-Quill." He grimaces at the last one. 

"But don't let me forget the Visitors of Prosperity, the Yellow Moguls, the Tenfold Palor..." He trails on for some time.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"How dreadful!" Harchiand Bronze places his hand to his heart. "Perhaps there were a few Raetommon loyalist still out for blood-" He notices his words are falling to deaf ears and drops his hands. "Oh, fuck it all."

"You gave me no other choice!" He quickly collects himself, before continuing more discreetly. "A Fatebinder sent from Cacophony suddenly appears asking questions about my loyalty?" He fans his hand away towards the Oldwalls. "I'm not daft, any Chorus member worth their tattoos will tell you that they'd find any reason to be next in line to go up the ranks. I'm merely staying two steps ahead of them."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They were once a powerful trade organization that... well..." He cups his mouth and glances around, "Let's just say that you didn't want to get between them and a contract."

"What with [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s new laws in the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url], the Quill slunk into the shadows of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' authority, trying to keep a lower profile. If you're involved in any of their dealings, stay far away."</DefaultText>

      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What bottle?" Harchiand turns, pulling on the end of his beard. He tries to follow the direction of your gesture. "There's no..."

Then his confusion clears, replaced by stark understanding. "Of course there's a bottle. And after you tell the authorities that I must have stashed or destroyed it, then it's your word against mine. Am I correct?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He opens a deep pouch, and you unceremoniously deposit a volume of rings - the clatter of which turns several heads. 

Harchiand shakes the pouch once and nods, content the agreed-upon sum is there.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His eyes widen and his once energetic and cheery facade quickly becomes still and cold. "I had thought we settled on the arrangement some time ago. Has something..." He frowns and waves for you to have on. "Ask your questions, then."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>67</ID>
      <DefaultText>He blinks and responds in a low tone. "I can hardly refuse a customer, can I? It would be suspect if I refused a servant of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] because of the color of their raiment." 

"I save my best goods and prices for the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url], but you cannot fault me for plying my trade..."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>He lowers his voice to a whisper. "But a loyal one. I had thought [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] would appreciate someone who knows how to play both sides. Let him know his trust isn't misplaced." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>71</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What? No! You're thinking of the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url]." He glances left and right. "I mean... if a [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] soldier buys a secondhand sword or helmet... then technically yes." He quickly tacks on a final word. "But only the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] sees my finest goods! I make sure of it!"</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>He rises up to his full height. "I am a professional, and I treat every transaction with the utmost confidence. [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]The Voices of Nerat[/url] should have no doubts on that account."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>75</ID>
      <DefaultText>His confidence falters. "I suppose that depends on what you're looking for... I keep a second set of records that factor in side dealings, but an authority would certainly realize that I do business with the Scarlet-" 

He realizes what he said and covers his mouth. "Did the Voices want me to keep them separate? By [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], I never thought anyone would ask!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>76</ID>
      <DefaultText>He brushes your point aside. "Like all merchants, I speak in platitudes and embellishment. The people find it amusing, and it sells cloth that my grandmother would not drape over her sick dog."

"I never bring up my dealings with [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url]."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>77</ID>
      <DefaultText>He chuckles. "I know better than that. [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]The Voices of Nerat[/url] is a shrewd businessman - it wouldn't surprise me if he kept tabs on every weapons deal I've conducted with his elite troops." He wonders for a moment. "Come to think of it, it also wouldn't surprise me if he didn't care at all."

"The way I see it, why would I chance angering a Scarlet Fury or Blood Chanter when I can settle for my agreed-upon fee?"</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>80</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Certainly not. Enemies are such... complications. So much feeding and upkeep, always looking over one's shoulder." He shoos away the concept. "Let my clients handle their enemies. I need only friends." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>81</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well... our arrangement specified that I deal weapons to the highest officers. The needs of the Horde are so insignificant by comparison...trifles, really." He looks for sympathy in your expression and doesn't find it. 

"So I make some extra profit off the rank and file. It's no more or less fair than any of my other dealings. Is... is that a problem?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Disgruntled, Harchiand Bronze crosses his arms and stares at you with bitter resignation.

"Listen, you can stand here all day questioning my loyalty to the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url], but we both know the irony in demanding answers from someone who serves the Archon of Secrets. I am a liar Fatebinder, and [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] pays me handsomely for such a service."

      <DefaultText>He shrugs. "What can I say? They make decent customers. I try to stay on their good side because I've seen how easily they come down on those that step out of line...

      <DefaultText>He shrugs. "I haven't seen much of them in the past few years.

      <DefaultText>Harchiand shakes his head. "I'm not sure. I've heard reports of the Brotherhood hiding inside the Oldwalls, but I don't think you should run headlong into what could be a large Brotherhood force."

"They've also recently been seen in the vicinity of Deserter's March. It might be a good idea to check that out first and see if you can gather any information about the Brotherhood inside the Oldwalls."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Harchiand's eyes widen when he sees the Keystone. "That's one of the Keystones to get inside the Oldwalls!" He turns the Keystone over in his hands as he speaks. "There's only one other entrance that I know of and it's in Twin Rivers. That's where the Brotherhood have been staying, so that's probably where they've been entering the Oldwalls." He hands the Keystone back to you. "If you go there, be careful!"

"Things have been pretty quiet here, so I don't think Raetommon will try attacking again. Reinforcements from the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] will be showing up soon anyway."</DefaultText>

"Retrieving the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] Master is still top priority, but if you can convince Raetommon to consider a visit to Cacophony, Nerat would be very thankful."</DefaultText>

"Word is the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] Master has arrived in [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]. You should probably go to the forge to find out what's happening. I will be able to speak to you after I get my bearings here." He points to the tier above you.

"I may have purposely slipped to Raetommon that the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] Master was headed to [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url], and perhaps the intent of her visit. You see, he was the perfect tool to get the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] Master into our grasp." He puts up his hands.
