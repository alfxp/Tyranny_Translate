      <DefaultText>"Well met, Fatebinder." Welby gives you a slight nod in greeting. "I had hoped you and I would cross paths again. Your timing in this instance was perfect. Thank you for your help."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You're here for Raetommon, aren't you?" Welby nods as if she's answering her own question. "I won't waste your time. He's gone - as is the keystone you'll need to get to him. That half-wit brute Myrek took it to Deserter's March." She spits when she says Myrek's name.

"He went to gather more support for Raetommon's maddening plot..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Relief washes over her worn face. "You have my gratitude, Fatebinder. But it will have to wait until you've retrieved the Keystone and this mad man has been dealt with..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"How lucky for us to have the Fatebinder of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] show up at just the right time." The officer gives you a warm smile. "We haven't met, but I saw you with Raetommon and Will on Ironhaul Trail. My name is Welby. Your arrival is a pleasant surprise."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Much as I'd love to discuss the matter at length, I just don't have the time." 

Her face pulls into a wince. 

"And I fear I won't have time until this issue with Raetommon is dealt with.  Try me later, when I'm not trying to keep a crazy man from destroying my home."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's going to be a lot of slogging through a break-in period, but I think it will go well. Raetommon left some unfinished business, so there's plenty of opportunity to prove myself. Not that I especially needed it - or wanted it - but it's mine to bear all the same." She smiles.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That is wonderful news! Unfortunately, this is only the first puddle of Beastmen piss we have to deal with. We must get inside the Oldwalls and confront Raetommon. And I know that's not going to be easy going. Let me know when you are ready and we'll go together."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"His growing mania with the Bane has exploded into an obsession. I think he's planning on using them to purge [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] of all the 'unworthy.'"

She points emphatically at the Oldwalls as she speaks. "The problem is, the Bane know nothing of 'worth.' All they know is death and chaos. If Raetommon is allowed to go through with this, [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] will be destroyed."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Brothers out here are outraged by Raetommon's betrayal. He's gone crazier than a Candle Mountain miner. So, if you are here to help, we'll take any help we can to get that Keystone back from Deserter's March. I've got my hands full here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I was hoping to see you again, Fatebinder." Welby looks at the bodies of the Scourge. "You picked the perfect time to show your face."

"Normally I would ask you to explain yourself." She gives you a stern look. "Indiscriminately attacking those with different views from yours is the sign of a small mind. But, in light of recent events, I am inclined to agree with your methods."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I dealt with Raetommon. You are now the leader of the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <ID>131</ID>
      <DefaultText>Welby's eyes widen and her mouth drops open. "What..." She trails off. "He's dead?" She shakes her head and stares at you. "I'm sorry. This news is a little overwhelming."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>132</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her voice cracks a little as she continues. "I...I knew it had to be done, but..." She smiles ruefully. "I had no idea how sad the news would make me. Thank you, Fatebinder. You have done a wonderful thing not only for the Brotherhood, but for all the people of [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]."

"If you need anything, let me know."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Welby puts up a hand, looking up at you from her knees. "I yield, Fatebinder. This fight is not worth my life. You have won." Her breath is ragged and wet.</DefaultText>

      <ID>136</ID>
      <DefaultText>"This is not your concern, Fatebinder. I might not agree with what Raetommon is doing, but I will not have someone come in and take care of my problems for me. He will be stopped, but I will be the one to stop him."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Welby stares at you for a few moments before finally sagging, defeated. "You are right. Raetommon has sealed himself in the Oldwalls and Myrek took the only other Keystone. I can't open the doors for you. You need the Keystone." She winces and touches her side. Her fingers come away red.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Welby sighs and shakes her head. "I am sorry, Raetommon. I wanted to save you, even though I knew I couldn't." She looks up at you, pale and shaking.

"Myrek headed off toward Deserter's March. He was hoping to bring more of our Brothers back here to regroup..." She coughs, flecks of blood spraying across the ground in front of her.

"Well, that can't be good..." She slumps forward onto the ground, dead.</DefaultText>

      <ID>145</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I have no clue, Fatebinder. I have tried repeatedly to talk him out of this insane plot and nothing I say gets through. Maybe he will listen to someone who isn't so close to him."

"He responds most to flattery lately. Maybe you can butter him up..."</DefaultText>

"I'm not going to be able to go with you, Fatebinder. I'm in no condition to fight right now. I have no doubt you'll be able to handle yourself in there. Good luck."</DefaultText>
