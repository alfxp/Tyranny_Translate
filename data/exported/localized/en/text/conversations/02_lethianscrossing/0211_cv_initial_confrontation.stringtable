      <DefaultText>"Raetommon is a murderer, a thief, and a coward! How can you stand with him?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He went too far! Death is inevitable in war, but slaughtering innocent settlers? What possible reason could he have had to kill them?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They were regrettable, but necessary, deaths! Raetommon needs the helmet if we want to keep [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] out of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' hands!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Locke looks back and forth between you and Myrek and sighs. "You are right, Fatebinder." He addresses Myrek. "Have your men lower their weapons and I will have my men do the same."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Myrek hesitates and lowers his weapon. "No. There has been too much death already."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He won't budge. He will blindly follow Raetommon off a cliff."</DefaultText>

      <ID>12</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Myrek, please - following Raetommon will only end in your death. He can't be trusted. He killed his own men. He endangered the entire city for his own selfish needs!"</DefaultText>

      <ID>13</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Raetommon is doing what he needs to in order to save us all. If some people have to die in order for him to achieve that end, it's the price of our freedom! And it's obvious you will never see that. I'm sorry, Locke, but you must pay for your betrayal."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You are welcome to try, but he is stubborn. I don't think he will change his mind."</DefaultText>

      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>"He will not change his mind. We can't have him warning Raetommon. He must die."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Locke nods. "I'm sorry, Myrek, but you have forced my hand. I can't let the Brotherhood be torn down by those I call friends. If you won't help me purge the sickness, you must be excised as well."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Myrek - think about what it used to mean to be a Brother and what the Brotherhood used to be! The Raetommon we knew would never do these horrible things to his own men! You will die if you keep with him!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You know him. You're close to him. If anyone can convince him, it's you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But he has never led us wrong, Locke. Don't you remember? Nothing could stop us! No one could hold us back! What happened?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Could you two lovers just finish each other off so we can get going? Are you helping me or not?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I can only help Raetommon if you help me, Myrek."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>Myrek's face flushes with anger. "Take my pain and make it a joke, Fatebinder. Why did I think you truly wanted to help? Raetommon is right to hate you and I will make sure you never get to him."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Help us, Myrek. Raetommon must be stopped - any way we can."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Myrek's shoulders droop, his head bobbing in a small nod. "I know." He pulls a glowing stone from a pouch and holds it out to you. "This is the Keystone. It's the only way into the Oldwalls at Twin Rivers. That's where you'll find Raetommon."</DefaultText>

      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No." Myrek shakes his head defiantly. "Raetommon may have his flaws, but I am a failure as a soldier if I don't follow my leader regardless of his shortcomings." He faces Locke, his eyes wet. "I am sorry, Brother, but the price of betrayal is death."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Locke places a hand on Myrek's shoulder. "Thank you, Myrek. It's time to stand on your own and make your own path. I am glad I have not lost yet another Brother today."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Necessary? Do you hear what you're saying? That was a slaughter! And now the Crossing is vulnerable! If the Helm isn't returned, the Bane will overwhelm it!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>Myrek turns to face you, recognition dawning in his eyes. "Oh, this pig-fucker. You would like that, wouldn't you, Fatebinder? It wasn't enough for you to slaughter my brothers at Twin Rivers. Now you've come to watch us turn on each other."

He slams his hammer into the ground, knocking clumps of dirt apart in an angry spray. "Locke, you quarrel with a brother-in-arms while our enemy stands right here, mocking us!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>Myrek takes notice of you, shaking his head in disgust. "So says the one who put Brotherhood soldiers to the sword at Twin Rivers. No, Fatebinder, I will not calm down. Raetommon was right to consider you a threat."

      <DefaultText>Locke quickly glances between you and Myrek, eyes wide in alarm. "If the Fatebinder has murdered our friends, then he must be put down. That is clear." 

"But, I cannot stand with Raetommon either, Myrek. He's always been a bull-headed leader. That had its uses, and that's why I followed him. But if he means to kill the people we claim to protect, then he's no better than [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s lapdog here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No better." Myrek takes a deep breath, nodding to himself in a moment of clarity.

"Raetommon sent me to retrieve any loyal soliders that I could find. Loyal soldiers, Locke... I assumed that would include you, but apparently I was wrong." He spits at this feet. "The penalty for disloyalty is death."

He points his hammer at his former comrade, and then at you. "What are you all waiting for? Let's get to it, already. Your skulls aren't going to crush themselves."</DefaultText>
