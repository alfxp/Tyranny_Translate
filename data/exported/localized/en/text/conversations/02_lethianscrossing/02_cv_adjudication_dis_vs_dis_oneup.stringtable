      <DefaultText>"You know nothing, Livia. Instead of running, I hid behind Fausto as he was impaled, then let his body fall on top of me and used it as camouflage so the enemy would think I was dead. At least by fleeing you left yourself open for an honorable battlefield death."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Between us, I have caused more disappointment with my behavior. Clearly my failures should result in a much harsher punishment.

In my horrible state of self-preservation, I caused the death of a friend. This is on top of pushing Nona into another group of Brotherhood so she would delay them as I ran.
