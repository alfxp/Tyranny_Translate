      <DefaultText>"While I appreciate your help dealing with that merchant, I'm afraid I can't let you pass until you have spoken with our leader, Raetommon. Personally, I thought he was crazy saying you'd be visiting [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]. Looks like I owe him a few rings."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You are walking a dangerous line, Fatebinder. The [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url] never back down from threats." He pauses for a moment, sizing you up.

"Normally I'd knock you down where you stand for threatening me, but Raetommon demanded to see you if you came through here. I thought he was crazy saying you'd be visiting [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]. Looks like I owe him a few rings."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Raetommon sent a signal that I'm supposed to let you pass without paying the toll." He moves to the side to let you through.

"Such a shame. I would love to see if your money spent differently than anyone else's..." He jerks his thumb over his shoulder, indicating you should go.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Will barks out a short laugh. "Now that's a question with a hundred answers! Simple one? He's the current leader of the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url]. If you want to know anything more, I suggest you go find him and talk to him."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He points south. "He's right there, inspecting the corpses of some of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' solders. He's bound to be in a good mood right now."

He winks at you. "All those dead bodies? Must be heaven for him!" The color drains from his face as soon as the words leave his lips. "Please don't tell him I said that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Will returns to his position and looks you over, his former genial mood gone. "So, a Fatebinder in our little corner of the world. Who'd have ever thought this would happen." He spits between his feet then crushes it into the dirt with his boot.</DefaultText>

      <ID>12</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Out in the middle of nowhere? No. Your station means about as much as a whore to a eunuch."

He holds out his hand, palm up, and taps his finger in the middle of it. "Money is what matters to us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He reaches for the rings and stops short of taking them and lets out a giant sigh. "No. You'd better see Raetommon. I'll catch the bad side of a Beastman's claws if I let a Fatebinder through without an audience."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Will smirks and shakes his head. "Nice try, Fatebinder, but if I don't see a sign from Raetommon, not even [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] himself would be getting through here."</DefaultText>

      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well, it's not like leader of the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url] is a lifelong calling." Will stops, his brow wrinkling.

"Actually, that's exactly what it is... See, if someone wants to claim the current leader's authority for their own, they can do it at any time."</DefaultText>

      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Of course that means a challenge of some sort. And that always ends with the death of one - or more - of the participants."

"Raetommon survived a night in the Oldwalls. That was enough to prove to most of the Brotherhood that he was the right man for the job."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Sellsword! Attend me. I take it your responsibilities have been explained to you? Keep the rabble on this side of the bridge, yes? That does not preclude taking orders from your betters." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Is your name Raetommon? Are you the leader of the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url]?"

He cups his ear to listen. 

"No? I didn't think so. Because he decides who crosses and who doesn't. If you have a problem with that, take it up with him."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ashe forgive me, but I can only endure so much of this fool's inane jabbering." 

A blur of rusted metal precedes a deafening crunch as Barik backhands the mercenary, leaving a significant mark behind.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The mercenary's mouth hangs open in disbelief. He swallows and attempts to gather his pride. 

"I would help you, but my boss told me to guard this bridge. No one gets by without Raetommon's permission."</DefaultText>

Verse swings her fist and lands a punch with a meaty whack, snapping back the mercenary's head.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Beastwoman prowls forward, muscles quivering from her eagerness, saliva frothing on her tongue as she pants and snuffs her hot breath into the sellsword's face. 

"Smells rank, but will devour for Alpha."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Will laughs and stares at Kills-in-Shadow for a few moments.

"You're welcome to try, Fluffy, but I'm sure I'd give you indigestion. And even if I disappeared, Raetommon still wants to see you. You're not getting through."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We're on a mission, and staring at your ugly mug and catching up on the past won't get it done any faster. Are you going to move on, or do I need to start cutting? Because I'm partial to either option." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"One of two things will happen - either you will let us pass, or we will simply pass. There are no other options. Whatever role you have taken upon yourself to bar our way has already failed. You succeed only in delaying our task... and annoying me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She glances back at you and sneers, hand lowering slightly in the air. But then she swipes hard for his face - claws raking the length of his cheek.

"Beastwoman will not be insulted so easily. Whine human, whimper for Kills-in-Shadow if don't want to die."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>At first it seems she will rip out his entrails, but at the last moment, she reigns in her bloodlust, deciding - likely for her pack's sake - to spare him. Instead, she swipes hard for his face, her claws raking the length of his cheek.

"Beastwoman will not be insulted so easily. But also will not so easily risk Alpha's safety. Can smell many more-than-five with iron-claws hiding in Haven's shadows. Will hunt human again - when Beastwoman is alone."</DefaultText>
