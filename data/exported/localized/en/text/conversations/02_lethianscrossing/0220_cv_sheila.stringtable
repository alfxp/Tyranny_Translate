      <DefaultText>A beautiful dark-skinned woman dances slowly by herself, her hands moving over the curves on her body. Her shirt is barely held closed over her breasts by a single button which she is playing with while she dances. "What can I do for you this beautiful day?" She watches you closely as her hand leaves the button and slowly traces the line of her cleavage. "If you want a good time, then you've come to the right place. Sheila is here to take care of you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Now why would you want to spoil the mood and talk about regular life." She pouts and stops dancing. Her shoulders droop and she wrinkles her nose. "I'm a wonderful mother and I'm only doing this to care for my wonderful children. Without me, they'd be lost!" She lets out a hearty laugh. "Can you just imagine? Me? A mother?" She laughs again. "Who I am doesn't matter, you sweet thing. What I can do is what matters. And what I do can make you forget about everything that troubles you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, I'm no expert in the area of the magical arts, but I do know a trick or two. Mix that with my true skills and you have something that will curl your toes and have you singing my praises to the whole town. Let me give you the Tidecaster's Flow. Everyone will ask you how you sing so loudly."</DefaultText>
