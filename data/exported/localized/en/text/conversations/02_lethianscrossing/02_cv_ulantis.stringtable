      <DefaultText>Ulantis takes another hard look at you. "I'm no fool, Fatebinder. It wouldn't be the first time one of [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url]'s birds has come around to make sure his operation here runs smoothly. I can assure you, no one here is trying to shake things up." His gaze again travels over towards Lohara.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His gaze wanders over to Lohara, his eyes locked on her like prey. "You are not the first to request services outside our normal traditions, nor will you be the last. Lohara has grown more stubborn since her mentor Zdenya was killed." His attention comes back to you, his gazes appears to size you up. "But if you can provide a vacancy in her position, ensure that it's filled with those more deserving... then we can talk about this request of yours."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ulantis straightens up. "If you are acting alone, then you are responsible to no one but yourself. You must do something for me first."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ulantis uncrosses his arms. His full attention now rests with you. "You tread dangerous waters, Fatebinder." He moves in a bit closer while keeping an eye on the busy workers all around him. "Lohara has grown more paranoid, more watchful since her beloved mentor Zdenya was killed." He looks away with a sigh, dismissing the notion with a single breath. "It's not worth the risk."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ulantis takes a step back, his expression narrowing, his voice much quieter, more calculated. "I'm not privy to the game you are playing, but I wouldn't be opposed to a change in leadership. It was I who was in line to lead the operations for [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url]. Before Zdenya chimed in, unsurprisingly picking her prized pupil instead." His stare snaps back to Lohara, the glint of the firelight shining like daggers in his eyes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Lohara may be the boss around here, but I've made a few allies of my own. You'll have a few people to back you up if it were to come to it." He nods to you and slinks back into his regular posture.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His eyes carefully watch Lohara as he answers you. "Yes, but these are [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] matters. Nothing that concerns the high-court of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url], I can assure you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I keep things running smoothly - Upkeep mostly." He smiles coyly. "I am also second in command to Lohara, so in case anything ever happens her, I'm here to take charge."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I have brought you a few Azurelith Crystals. Perhaps you can use them in your work?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm returning the Litany of Incandescence to you and your [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url]. I know this is important to you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I have secured some of these special Distillates. They will surely speed up the work done here by your Forge Bound."</DefaultText>

      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>Ulantis looks over the crystals for a few moments. "Yes, I'm fairly certain I can do something with these, just a moment."</DefaultText>

      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>Ulantis' eyes grow wide with glee. "To be in the position that I am now when the Litany of Incandescence is returned to the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] is an unmeasurable gift. You have granted us a tremendous boon today, Fatebinder. I am in your debt again."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I shattered three perfectly good chisels trying to shape these stubborn crystals into something sharp... then I wrangled my hubris, and started working with the material, not against it."

With a beaming smile, the artisan-mage presents you with a staff adorned in Azurelith crystals. "One of my finest works to date. Have it with my blessings, I ask only that you carry it with you while you achieve greatness."</DefaultText>

      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>Ulantis looks around to the other [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url], annoyed. "A bit slower than I'd like." His voice rises to catch more ears then just you and him. "They just need more time to adjust to the way I like to do things." He laughs to himself. "I'm just glad I don't have Lohara in my ear all day."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes, Garrick was surprised to see the state of things upon arriving back at the Forge. Although, his loyalty rested with Lohara - I'll see to it that he makes the necessary adjustments." He nods to Garrick who anxiously watches you two speak. "Otherwise, his services will no longer be needed."</DefaultText>

      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>Ulantis inspects the state of the tools. "Fine tools, perhaps more useful to us then who previously possessed them. Here, take this as a token of my gratitude."</DefaultText>

      <ID>62</ID>
      <DefaultText>Ulantis catches the stare of Lohara who beams at him expecting something to occur. Ulantis sighs dejectedly before turning his attention back to you with a strained smile. "Forgive me Fatebinder, Lohara instructed me to reward you for your aid during the conquest. [url=lore:lc_iron_must_flow]The conscripted Beastmen helped us forge countless iron materials[/url] and in return, I am to show you the location of a supply cache." 

Ulantis takes your map into his hands, and circles a small clearing in Haven.

      <DefaultText>Ulantis blinks his face wrought with disbelief. "You never mentioned..." He quickly summons some fortitude as a sense of dissension grows among his own [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] allies. "Yes, my end of the bargain will be upheld. I'll await further instruction from the Archon of Secrets."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I can't believe Lohara was made the new Master of the Forge." Ulantis sneers at Lohara when she turns away. "I am far more qualified for the position and she keeps getting the glory..." He sighs.

"Oh, well... I suppose there isn't anything that can be done about it."</DefaultText>
