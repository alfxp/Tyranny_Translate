      <DefaultText>Stepping forward and planting your leg down firmly, you trip Sandro as he bolts forward into a sprint.

Landing first on his knees then his hands, Sandro curses and hollers in surprise. When the dust settles, he limply rises to his knees, shoulders slumped in defeat.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"She said what?" Sandro's face blanches, his eyes widen in surprise. "The Brotherhood? Absolutely not! Do I look like I could even lift an axe without hurting myself?"

He reaches for his head, fingers digging into his hair. "I saw her... saw Deya kill Phaedra! She killed her own wife and blamed..." His head slumps. "That motherless trollop is trying to frame me!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Won't be forgetting it no matter how hard I try!" He wipes at his eye, his body shaking. "It was Deya! I watched her kill her own wife!"

      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"This?!" He touches the simple turquoise medallion around his neck. "It's mine! Phaedra bought it for me in Ardent ten years ago!"

Sandro looks about. "Did Deya tell you this was Phaedra's necklace? That's absurd! The necklace is a symbol of the friendship Phaedra and I had."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Sandro eyes you with suspicion. "She lies about me so now I should lose my necklace? The one that Phaedra gave me?"

He grabs the turquoise medallion and runs it between his fingers for a long moment. "Fine, take it. If it brings Deya to justice then it's worth the price."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Indeed I am! I can't stomach it anymore. I thought I'd get used to seeing people die but the Brotherhood and their raids... there's just no end in sight!"

He kicks at the soil, his hands idly playing with his necklace as his feet shuffle anxiously. "I just want to be away from the folk of the Crossing right now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"How should I know?! Deya was never very happy with her, and she wasn't happy that Phaedra and I were friends. Phaedra never should have married her!"

      <DefaultText>Alarmed, Sandro throws up his arms to stave you off. "Please, have mercy! You see, Phaedra... well, she was Lethian's granddaughter. As Lethian's only known female heir, she inherited the land that [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] sits on. But she didn't like to make a fuss about it. She just did what was needed to ensure the future of the town and left it at that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He looks around nervously and whispers. "Deya, on the other hand, wanted more. I think she'd tax the merchants till near their breaking point, if she was able."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>He takes a long, deep breath. "Because I told Phaedra not to marry Deya, and she has always hated me for that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Phaedra and I have been friends since childhood. We promised to always be honest to each other, even when it hurts. When Phaedra left to live in the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url], I stayed in [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] to keep an eye on things for her."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Then Phaedra told me she'd fallen in love. I was initially happy for her, but when she brought Deya back to [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] to meet me, I could see right away that Deya wasn't interested in Phaedra aside from what Phaedra could offer her."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What any woman could gain - land. Phaedra owned her home in [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]. Not many can make that claim."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>64</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Essentially, yes. I don't think Deya ever loved Phaedra. She's always had other motives."

"Phaedra was head over [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] in love with Deya. She was charismatic - always knew what to say to Phaedra to make her smile. But as soon as Phaedra's back was turned, Deya's fangs would start to show, in a manner of speaking I mean."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Deya was always pushing Phaedra to increase the number of rings they collected from the merchants. Fortunately, Phaedra wouldn't have it. She loved [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] and refused to manipulate its people for her own gain."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He looks down at what he's wearing. "Oh this, I'm... I'm not actually a Brotherhood soldier." He stops for a moment, gaging your reaction. 

"It was the only way I could see to get out of [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] alive. Deya was trying to find me. I thought it best to disguise myself as a Brotherhood sellsword and follow them. I found a dead Brother and donned some of his armor. I didn't really have time to figure out how to put it all on, but it worked well enough to get me here."</DefaultText>
