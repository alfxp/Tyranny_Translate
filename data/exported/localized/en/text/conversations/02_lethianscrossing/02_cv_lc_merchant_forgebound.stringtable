      <DefaultText>"Welcome, friend!" The merchant cries out to you, his belt jingling with rings. He waves his arms about in a dramatic presentation of his wares. "What brings you to my humble trading post? Have a certain something in mind or just browsing?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Custom work? You'll need to speak with the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] themselves - they do not usually sell their masterworks - or at least, not without discussions ahead of forging."

"I sell only the apprentice pieces - works of iron and bronze that are finer that almost any you'll find in the Tiers, but to the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url], these pieces aren't worthy of collection or commemoration, and are to be sold."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And if you should ask, be cautious in how you haggle. A [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] master is an easy beast to offend - they just don't put the same value on a copper ring that the rest of us do."

He shrugs. "And remember that every officer in [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' army wants a day of their time - keep that in mind."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh, my..." He stops himself and just stares at you for a moment. "Fatebinder! How... wonderful it is to have you at my stand. Your [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] usually keeps people away, so any customer is a welcome customer! What can I help you with?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, if it isn't the Fatebinder!" The man bows deeply, making a production of it. "Anyone who has the potential of ridding the world of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' rule is welcome here! What can I help you with today?"</DefaultText>
