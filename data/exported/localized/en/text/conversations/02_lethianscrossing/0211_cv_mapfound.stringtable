      <DefaultText>The map found on Myrek is heavily worn, but decipherable. It crudely depicts the location of several [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url] encampments scattered throughout Haven. Judging by the number of crossed-out markers, it would appear that the rebels are frequently on the move. You notice one camp located to the northeast, situated against the Oldwalls near some merging waterways you recognize as the Twin Rivers. This is likely the Brotherhood stronghold Harchiand Bronze mentioned earlier, and a good place to continue your hunt for Raetommon and Zdenya.</DefaultText>
