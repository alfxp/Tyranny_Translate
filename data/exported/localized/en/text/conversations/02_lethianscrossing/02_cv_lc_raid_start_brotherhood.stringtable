      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder! We need your help!" The soldier runs up, his words punctuated by his labored breathing. "Raetommon took the Magebane Helmet while you were in the Oldwalls! When Ceratha tried to stop him and his guards, they started slaughtering everyone - it didn't matter if they were Brotherhood or a townsperson! It's like he's gone crazy!" He points east.

"Please, speak to him. We're unable to stop him!"</DefaultText>

When he heard news of the Master's arrival, he took it as a sign to act. The helmet is an extra prize!

      <DefaultText>The soldier takes a step backward, obviously not expecting this response. "You would really do that? Raetommon said you wouldn't dare attack us!" He takes another step. "You'll probably win this fight. I'm out of here!"
