      <DefaultText>"Strict curfews, frequent searches, and no forgiveness for missed iron and grain quotas. That's the ill of it."

"But the sentries keep constant vigil and treat us with respect - politeness, even. Most of them call me 'elder' and bow. If someone's going fishing in your pocket and taking your crops, may as well be kind about it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A few have passed through the Crossing in recent times, all headed south to the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url]. At least that's the word of it - the mages didn't stay for long."

He gestures to the massive stone facade of the Oldwalls. "And I'm glad they kept on traveling. If some madman cast a spell that cracked the foundation of the Oldwalls... praise [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] it hasn't happened!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I uh... I don't wish to endanger anyone is all but..." Eldian scans in both directions, his voice barely rising above a whisper.

"The [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] is a blight upon us! My niece, my nephew, and a score of our best farmhands were forcibly conscripted into that sickening mob! Soon we'll all be part of the swarm and there will be no one in the village to protect!"</DefaultText>

      <ID>87</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The biggest pain in the ass I ever knew?" He turns bright red, blushing at his words, then lets out a huge guffaw. "I suppose I shouldn't talk about my mother like that... She was a mediocre merchant but a great leader. The war in the Northern Kingdoms cost her a very lucrative trade route up north, but she managed to earn trade stewardships from [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], and for a short time she had a monopoly on grain, salt, and tin here in the Tiers."

"What did my grandmother say? 'Give a blind man time and a pile of rocks and eventually he'll hit a target.'" He shrugs. "Not to say she didn't deserve it, but I think luck played a bigger part in her success than actual talent."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] gives... and [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] takes... the next year, Lethian was stripped of her trade rights. Suddenly she had a large staff but no goods to trade and no means to pay anyone."

"But she was a stubborn one and knew if she just kept at it, eventually things would turn around for her. She figured the trade goods could come to us - the location was good enough. It's crazy how that would happen."</DefaultText>

      <ID>89</ID>
      <DefaultText>"So she decided to concentrate on making an existing local settlement into the center of commerce for the Tiers and by the claws of a beast, she did just that. I thought she was crazy choosing a town nestled up to the Oldwalls, but apparently she knew what she was doing! It wasn't long after that it was renamed [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]. With the bridges over the Oldwalls, this was the only place to go if you wanted to take weeks off of your trip."

"Eventually, she hired the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url] to act as our local guards. We were big enough and had enough commerce to warrant the protection."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The siege of Ardent and the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url] ended up helping us - all those folks heading to points east crossed through our little settlement and many of them decided to stake a claim with us."

"By then Lethian discovered there was iron in our rivers... She thought it'd make us rich, but it also made us a target."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Oldwalls don't make passage through the area easy, and our bridges cut days-to-weeks off of a trip. [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] is the best bet to get your shipment where it needs to go. Mix a motherlode of iron ore into it and we suddenly had a target painted on us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Iron, plain and simple. Now we have the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] here, toiling away with the ore they pull from the river. We're being squeezed for our resources. 'If you're after a drink, better to squeeze fruit than a stone.' And it would seem many people find us to be very juicy indeed."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Land? Breeding stock? They've been here longer than I have so maybe they consider it home, too. But [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' purse masters are no longer paying them to fight. And if a mercenary is killing for free, something's suspect."

"In the end, I suppose it doesn't matter. Raetommon will never let go. He feels he owns this town and he aims to have it be his."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Lethian was the mastermind of that - she could tie a knot with one hand, one string. I remember watching her draw systems of ropes and knots in the sand, telling me what they would do when built - I thought she was crazy!"

      <DefaultText>"If I were to be honest, Fatebinder, I'm surprised more people haven't left - not just the merchants. The current tension in town between the Brotherhood and [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces is making [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] a very dangerous place to live."

      <DefaultText>"While it might not have been the best situation with the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url] maintaining control of [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url], at least they kept [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' armies out of town. Once they found iron in our river, suddenly everyone cared about who had control of the Crossing."

"With the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] here, I know that Ashe and Nerat would love to have access to the weapons they create."

      <DefaultText>Eldian shakes his head. "Sometimes I wonder why Lethian thought it was a good idea to settle here. We already had a Bane problem before the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] set up here. Now that they're using the Crossing as one of their main forges, the Bane issue is even worse. Since the Bane are drawn to magical energy, we have to be on constant alert for them escaping." </DefaultText>

"The sealed door is only a temporary measure, though. It holds the Bane back for now but it won't last for much longer. That is why [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] instructed Zdenya to create an artifact to protect [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] from the Bane."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The river is named Portuscor and it flows down the middle of the settlement. The waterfalls pouring over the Oldwalls are Sunrise and Moonrise. The west waterfall is Sunrise because of how the sun hits it in the morning and Moonrise got its name due to how it glows during a full moon."</DefaultText>

"The different levels of [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] don't really have names but most people refer to them as the tiers. My home is considered part of the ground tier, the forge is on the first tier, both in the Moonrise district."</DefaultText>

'A smart man keeps both eyes open, a fool walks around with one shut.'" He holds out the Keystone and a piece of vellum. "This is a rubbing that Lethian gave me years ago...

"Nobody will stop you, Fatebinder, if that's what you mean. If you have business inside, I can only assume that it must be an important matter. The Oldwalls are unpredictable, plain and simple.
