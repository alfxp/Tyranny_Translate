      <DefaultText>"He is out fishing. He didn't want to speak to me, said he needed time to think." He scratches his arms. "You didn't say anything to him did you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Gino's eyes narrow into tiny slits which still don't manage to mask the glowing rage within them. "I know what I saw, and so do you. I will not be bullied any longer by [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' pawns." He hoists his sack of supplies over his shoulders and turns and walks away without acknowledging Alagan.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Gino eyes glaze in a bitter rage, "Why Alagan, after all these years, why?!" His shout echoes throughout the settlement.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I saw the bodies myself. They are [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] Blood Chanters - killed by [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Gino's face grows still while his lips remain as the only thing in motion. "...And you never will. Begone from here, Alagan. Never show your face again."

Alagan's lips tremble in a failed attempt to mutter a reply but eventually falls victim to the weight of his head as it droops down. He picks a small sack nearby and slowly scampers off.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Alagan shrinks in place, his knees wobbling in an increasingly difficult effort to keep him from toppling over. "F-Father always favored you, always pushed me around. I just wanted a chance to run things for once!"</DefaultText>
