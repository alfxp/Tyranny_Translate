      <DefaultText>"My sister, Kalea, disappeared when the Brotherhood showed up, and I haven't seen her since."

"She seems to have this idea that [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] would do better in the hands of the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url]. I've tried to persuade her otherwise, but she won't listen."</DefaultText>

"People are saying they were headed toward Deserter's March when they ran off. Will you look for her? I have no means of doing it myself. I'm not a fighter and I have no skills in confrontation."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He nods slowly, a sense of confirmation in his haunted stare.

      <DefaultText>"You monster!" He takes a couple of steps toward you, but stops himself and points at the door. "Leave. Get away from me, or I'll... I'll..."

      <DefaultText>The last of his optimism vanishes. "Oh, my poor Kalea. You could have been so much more..." He looks at you with tears in his eyes. "Thank you for telling me, Fatebinder. Please, take this as compensation for your time."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He takes a deep breath, steadying himself. "My sister Kalea and I watched the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url] fending off multiple waves of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces when they tried to take the Crossing. I was terrified, but she was... exhilarated. In a way, I've never seen her so alive."
