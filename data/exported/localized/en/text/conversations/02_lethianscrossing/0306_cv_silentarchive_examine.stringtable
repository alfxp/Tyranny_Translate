      <DefaultText>A nimbus of magical energy surrounds this scroll, which levitates above the central platform. You see characters upon the parchment, but they seem to shift from one language to the next.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You reach out to touch the scroll, but as soon as your hand passes through the cloud encasing it, a violent tremor erupts in the hall. The shaking continues for a few seconds, and then vanishes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I would proceed cautiously, Fatebinder. Not even these ruins should remain standing after [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]. I suspect the Sages used the Silent Archive in some way to stave off destruction."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The parchment's surface is impossible to read, ever-shifting and convoluted. You see characters from Old Verdant written over calligraphy of the Northern Empire, which transforms into words used by the nomadic tribes of ancient Azure, and then again into phrases of the common tongue of the Tiers.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Indeed, the Silent Archive is meant to be the final source of knowledge. Every text we have magically transcribed bubbles beneath its surface, waiting to be called forth."

She eyes the scroll hungrily.

"Shadowhunter, too, will learn. Will listen to scroll's whispered warnings."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"How did they fit so many words on that scroll?"

He scratches at his breastplace, which rings out in a deafening screech.

      <DefaultText>The passage fades away, only to be replaced by another.

"The Silent Archive is the 100-year endeavor of the School of Quill and Ink. As one of its creators and guardians, I have ensured that its knowledge may only be accessed by the Sages of my order, and only those specifically charged with such a weighty responsibility. The Silent Archive is, thus, a glittering jewel that only a few may see. Should the artifact fall into outsider hands, I expect that less than one in a hundred of its secrets will be revealed in the span of a lifetime."

      <DefaultText>Thanks to Renata's guidance, you are able to quickly discern the nature of the magic at play here.

While the nature of the ongoing spell isn't clear, it seems very likely that Renata's claim is correct - the Silent Archive is being used as the focus for the protective magics.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You delicately remove the Silent Archive from the central pedestal, careful to replace it with another artifact in the span of a few seconds. The lines of energy flowing through the platform's center warble and distort disconcertingly for a moment, accompanied by faint tremors that unsettle the molten liquid below. 

After a few seconds of uncertainty, the spell's magic refocuses upon the newly-placed object, its lines of energy once again resuming their stable flow upward and out to the rest of the [url=glossary:burning library]Burning Library[/url]. The swap appears to have worked, and you have earned yourself the Silent Archive for your trouble.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>All that remains is to take the artifact outside.
