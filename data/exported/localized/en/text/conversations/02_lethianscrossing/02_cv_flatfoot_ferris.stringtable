      <DefaultText>Ferris shrugs. "I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Myrek never was the strongest soldier. Nice enough guy and fiercely loyal, but I'm surprised he lasted as long as he did. Still, that doesn't explain how you got here or why."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We don't have time for lengthy debates." Welby steps closer to Ferris. "We have to stop Raetommon before he kills us all. His desperate need to 'win' is going to end in disaster.

      <DefaultText>"Oh, I'm convinced." The sarcasm drips from his words "Raetommon does what he needs in order to ensure our safety. If some die in the process, it's the price we pay. Now, if you don't have anything else, I suggest you leave."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ferris' mouth opens in shock. "Would he really do that?" He looks around at the rest of the Brothers gathered in the room. None of them seem sure of themselves anymore.

He looks around for a few more moments. "All right. Say I believe you. What now? This is my home and I don't want to leave. And I certainly don't want to die."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What we do now is find Raetommon and stop him from making a fatal mistake. You've made the right decision, Ferris." Welby voice is filled with relief. "What can you tell us? Where is Raetommon? What is he doing?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>62</ID>
      <DefaultText>Ferris shrugs. "I have no clue. He told us to stay here and not to let anyone follow him." He looks around, thinking.

"Oh, we found this!" He reaches into a pouch and pulls out a strange-looking crystal. "No clue what it does, but it might help you." He holds it out to you. "Now, I've given you all the help you're going to get. You might be right, but I'm not going to push my luck. So..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ever since Raetommon spent a night inside to prove he was worthy to be the First Brother, he's spent more and more time in here. He said he mapped out the path so he can get through without attracting the Bane. And we've never had a problem as long as we stayed in this room."

      <DefaultText>Sirin hums just loud enough for you to hear. She sways, slowly moving her hands in front of Ferris' face as she does. His eyes quickly go out of focus and his head begins to follow the pattern made by Sirin's hands. She stops swaying and holds out a hand. Ferris stares at it for a few moments.</DefaultText>

Lantry steps forward, his ink-stained hand extended. "Please say yes, otherwise my friend here will start a fight, things will get messy." The old [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] rolls his eyes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Some of them attacked us, but most of them just kept going right out the door. Then Raetommon reappeared and the rest of the scourges just up and left!
