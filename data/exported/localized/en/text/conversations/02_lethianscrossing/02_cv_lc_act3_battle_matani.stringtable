      <DefaultText>"Thank you for your help, Fatebinder." Matani inhales sharply and bends over. "My injuries are a little more severe than I thought. I think I'll stay here for the time being." She stops and takes a few short breaths.

"I sent some soldiers up to the first tier to deal with the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url], but I was waylaid on my way to help Eldian. There are also some settlers trapped by the fire up there as well."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The settlers won't last long if they're left on their own, but the soldiers won't last forever trying to keep the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] at bay." She sighs, her face wincing with pain.

"I don't think there is enough time to deal with both problems. It's a terrible thing to ask of you, but you will need to decide who needs your help more."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You have to choose quickly. Take this bucket to use on the burning barricades. There are barrels full of water throughout the Crossing should you need them."

"If you get wounded in battle, return to me. I am no healer but I will help however I can!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Thank you for your help today, [Player Name]. Because of you, we were able to protect [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] from the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]. But today's battle makes me worry for the rest of the Tiers. If Ashe was brazen enough to attack [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] then [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] certainly won't think twice about attempting the same thing elsewhere..."</DefaultText>
