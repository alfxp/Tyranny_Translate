      <DefaultText>The bloody, dirt-smeared man cries out when he sees you. "Thank the forge-tender you found me! We have to get out of here before the Scourges come back - or the Brotherhood. I'm not sure which scares me more."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I was searching the area near the Oldwalls entrance for unique metals or runes I could use in my crafting." 

"I'm... I'm trying to advance to the next level of my apprenticeship. Impressing forge masters is much harder than it sounds and Master Lohara is especially demanding. You really need to stand out, and I thought this was my chance."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I didn't even know the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url] were here until some of them showed up. I grabbed a discarded helmet and tried to blend in until I could get away."

"Their leader thought I was a soldier who got stuck away from his post, so he demanded that I return to my duties. I was scared, so..." He shrugs with defeat, "I followed my 'orders' and went inside."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"As soon as I could get out of sight, I started running to find a way out. There's supposed to be a path to [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] somewhere..." He shakes his head, "But that could just be a story. Of course I got turned around and couldn't find my way back." 

"I barricaded myself in here to keep away from the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url] patrols and the Scourges roaming around. If you hadn't shown up, it would only have been a matter of time before something found me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Are you really just planning to take my tools and leave me here?" A look of weary resignation crosses his features. "I shouldn't be surprised. Everyone is only out for themselves anymore. Well, I'm not staying any longer. Better to die by your hand than the Scourges."

      <DefaultText>"She's strict but she makes sure things get done quickly and efficiently. And, like I said, she's also impossible to impress. I figured if I could find something in here to enhance my work, she'd have to notice me. Now all I'm going to get is a lecture." He looks around, a forlorn expression on his face.

      <DefaultText>"I would have, but I was committed to finding that connection with [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] and left behind the Brotherhood armor I found.
