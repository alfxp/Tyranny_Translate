      <DefaultText>"I caught this thief pawing through my wares, but this Chorus rat won't let me report her. By all rights, she should be in chains - not conscripted into some gang. What if she comes back and decides to shake down my business, this time with the law on her side? I can't stand by and let that happen." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Rubbish. My gang needs recruits - especially ones who are quick with their hands. We'll use little Wenhaver here to pick locks, pry apart traps and... well, let's just say nothing's off the table. Chances are good she'll lose some fingers before the fortnight is over anyhow." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"[url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] weapons and supplies. My things started to go missing weeks ago, but today I got wind that the little wretch had tried to fence my goods to another honest merchant. There's no telling how much she pocketed away or handed off elsewhere!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>14</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Full honesty? I've been watching the little thief stealing from the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] for weeks. I always had my eye on her for conscription - call this a test, and she passed it." Half Scar nods with pride. "Keen for a common settler, this one. Scarlet Fury material." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I wanted to be sure before I wasted anyone's time with baseless accusations. Until I caught her in the act, there was always a chance - a doubt in my mind - that a colleague was borrowing supplies and I had imagined the whole thing. That'll show me, huh? It's a sorry day when I'm punished for respecting due process." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Like I said, I wanted to see how capable she was, and if she could keep up the momentum. Did pretty well for an inexperienced little shit, didn't you Wen?" She aims a hard jab at the potential recruit.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We make a habit of conscripting survivors, and someone who knows how to steal for their livelihood is a valued addition to any gang. We don't always need thieves, but we always need survivors." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>She aims a hard glare at you, but it evens out with apprehension. "I lost everything in the conquest of Haven. Family, friends, home... all that I ever was got trampled by one army, then another. Stealing was the only way to survive. And stealing from the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url]... well, you can call that justice if you want." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Fool. The items you stole were worth ten times what you tried to sell them for." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Just because I'm a settler doesn't make me a savvy merchant. I needed to eat, not turn a profit." Wenhaver shakes her head. 

"Selling [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] goods for cheap also made people less likely to turn me in... I guess you could call that a professional move." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I... well, sure. I even sold to Half Scar once or twice. The Chorus aren't what you'd call disciplined." </DefaultText>

      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yeah, once, with her!" She points at Xenia. 

"I told her I was willing to do any menial task, but the hag turned me away without any consideration." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You bought our goods even though you knew they were stolen?" Xenia looks at Half Scar. </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"For research purposes only... aheh. I had to inspect the goods to confirm that Wenhaver was filching from the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url]."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>

      <DefaultText>"And produced a most competent and desperate new recruit for my gang - thank you, Xenia." Half Scar offers a mockery of a bow.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Shut up, Scar. I admit that I didn't think Wenhaver would be able to keep up with the workload, so I told her to move on. That's no invitation to steal from me, so I don't see how it's relevant." </DefaultText>

      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I don't know which is worse - losing a hand to the town guard, or getting tossed into the front lines. Either way, I suppose I'm at your mercy." Wenhaver looks at you with a desperate plea.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"In accordance with the laws of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], Wenhaver will face punishment for stealing from the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url]." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Each of you shares some fault, so none will be punished. You will have no dealings with each other from this point on. Is that understood?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I knew you'd make the right call." She turns to Wenhaver wearing an imperious expression. "You'll have to figure out another way to put food on the table, little girl. Whichever hand you choose to keep, make sure it's an earner." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Always a smart decision to fill up the ranks - especially when there's fresh talent to be fostered." She spreads a wicked grin. "Come along, Wen - I'll introduce you to your new family." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ha! Now that's Fatebinder justice for you. If you don't mind, I'll just take my new recruit and see if we can 'find' a mess in the forges for Xenia to clean up."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I might have preferred some punishment for the little thief, but in some measure this is just as good." She nods. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"At least I have something to do for the... well, the rest of my life, such as it is." She sighs. </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I suppose I can live with that." A hopeful smile spreads across her face. "It's a new opportunity, anyway, and a better one than either of these jackals would have for me." </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Oh, please. You're as guilty as me... somehow. And as for you, Fatebinder. Well, I guess I can always take my gang elsewhere, though the Voices won't be pleased by the lack of manpower." She offers a half-hearted salute and leaves.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A pity, but the Chorus will recover. We always do. And when a time of reckoning comes, our numbers will make this loss seem insignificant." She bids you farewell and leaves.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I figured if she was as good at her work as she seemed, we could assign her to a gang right away. As it happens, I was on my way to make an offer, but Xenia got to her first." </DefaultText>
