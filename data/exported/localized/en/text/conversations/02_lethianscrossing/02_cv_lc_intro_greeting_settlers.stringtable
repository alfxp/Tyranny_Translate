      <DefaultText>As you approach the entrance to [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url], you see two figures talking intently with each other. The woman points north as she talks. "I don't know if we can afford to stay here!"

"The region is too unstable and our business is suffering because of it! And if I have to pay one more 'toll' or hand over more 'guard money,' I won't have two rings to rub together!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The woman stops speaking when she sees you. "Fatebinder! You grace us with your presence!" She bows, then smacks her assistant on the back of the head. After a moment, the young man bows, too.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm not typically one to trade in gossip, Fatebinder, but the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url] aren't really the best people to be running [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]."

"They keep such a tight grip on everything and their leader has been acting a little crazy of late. I'm surprised anyone still wants them around. By my rings, I wish someone else - anyone - was making the rules here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, Fatebinder, I'm not one to speak ill of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' men, but the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] currently control [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] - and I'm not sure they're entirely qualified for the job."

"They keep a very stern watch over everything. No one I know is happy having them around. Now, I wouldn't normally say it, but I'd wager my last ring the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] might even be better!"</DefaultText>

"They keep such a close eye on everything. No one I know is happy having them around. Now, I wouldn't normally say it, but I'd wager my last ring anyone could do better - even the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url]!

      <DefaultText>She points to the east, beyond the river flowing through town. "Both of them can be found over there. Vintara likes being outside so she can maintain control everything that's happening. Eldian is probably in his house - near where Vintara's stomping around."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What is there to say? [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] was just coming into its own, the center of commerce for the Tiers, frequented by merchants from all over!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Me? Oh, Fatebinder, I'm simply a humble merchant and certainly of no consequence. My assistant and I were just trying to determine where we should go next."

"Conducting business in [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] has become a little too...volatile for my liking."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But if you're dead-set on dealing with them, their current enforcer in town is Ring-dropper Ceratha." She leans in, lowering her voice. "However, if you need to speak to someone, I suggest you find Eldian."

"He's the true leader of this town. Fair, knowledgeable, and very level-headed!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She sighs and looks around. "With the recent...unpleasant events, trade has all but dried up around here. We're lucky to get business at all! With the new 'toll' being enforced on the road to town, it's a wonder anyone comes here anymore."

"That's why I'm on my way out of here!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No!" The word comes out as a shout and she jumps a little. She looks down for a moment, regaining her composure.

"No." Her voice has a measured cadence as she speaks. "I just never expected to find myself in front of the Fatebinder. Welcome back to [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But after your recent...restructuring of power, that's not as much of an issue." She clears her throat, nervously glancing around. "Either way, It's too dangerous here, so I'm looking for a new place to ply my trade."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Of course! It's very simple." She points north, past the guards at the entrance. "Walk straight up there. His stand is in the middle of all the merchants on this side of the river. You can't miss him!"</DefaultText>
