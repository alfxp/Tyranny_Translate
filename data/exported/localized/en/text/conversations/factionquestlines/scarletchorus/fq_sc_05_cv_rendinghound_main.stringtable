      <DefaultText>The Beastman drops to all fours as you pull yourself onto the clifftop.

"Leave Beastman alone! Will not go back!" His body tenses, hair bristling down his back. "New pack made promises but did not provide." He flashes his teeth at you. "New pack promised!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Beastman pants, his fur slick with sweat and giving off a rancid stench of fear. "Fatebinder won't let Rending-Hound go, alive, no? But Beastman will not go back - will not obey Alpha who slaughters strongest of own pack. Means Alpha is sick, suffering and rabid. This much, Beastman understands."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Human... human will? Human isn't lying? Isn't setting trap for Rending-Hound?" Rending-Hound removes a necklace of scalps and tattered articles of clothing and hands it to you. "Take Beastman's trinket. Always was wearing. Proof of Beastman's triumphs. Will keep Chorus pack from Beastman's trail."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Why?! Why must Beastman be hunted! Rending-Hound could have fought Alpha in den called [Plainsgate], could have tried to tear out throat. But instead loped deep into Stone-lands. Why can Misery not let Beastman go?!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Turning to leave, he glances back for a moment and flares his nostrils - marking your scent forever into his memory. His lips curl into a weak smile. Discolored fangs gnaw at his bottom lip. Then he gives you a small, grateful nod before padding off tiredly into the distance. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Rending-Hound is outcast of [url=glossary:stonestalker]Stonestalker[/url] tribe. Left, thinking Chorus pack could be new kith. 'Even runts can have pride in Chorus,' humans said. But was only more, harsher pain!" Rending-Hound clutches his head in agony.

"Chorus is no den for Beastmen. Pack requires vicious deeds... Rending-Hound rip-tore and slaughtered, did all that Misery asked, but Alpha was not pleased, in return only gnashed human teeth. Beastman wishes only to be alone. Please."</DefaultText>
