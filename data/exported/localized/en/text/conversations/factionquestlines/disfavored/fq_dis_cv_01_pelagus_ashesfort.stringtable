      <DefaultText>"I don't know how we'll recover from the loss of [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]. His academic value alone may never have its equal."

"However, the Earthshakers are safely restored to Ashe's fort, and that gives me hope."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Our history stretches back before the coming of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Peace. The Earthshakers were content to live on the fringes of society, hiring our services out to villages in exchange for a modicum of protection and secrecy."

"When walls needed building or maintenance, the Earthshakers were always within reach to lend a hand."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Our most high-profile work involved mending breaches in the Oldwalls, which undoubtedly earned the favor of higher authorities."

      <DefaultText>"When [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] brought a new order to the North, our guild was content to remain in the shadows and sit out the invasion. We prided ourselves at staying withdrawn, untouched by the world's larger concerns."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A wistful look transports him to some far-off memory. 

"With the advance of the Overlord, so followed [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url], the Archon of Stone."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He seems overtaken by a well of deep mourning. 

"Then we discovered [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url], the Archon of Stone. He fascinated us, and we admired him in turn."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The coming of [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] changed everything. In his power, we recognized the apex of our aspirations - the ultimate expression of our magical art." 

"After some debate among our elders, the Earthshakers pledged fealty to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]. We could not, in all conscience, pass the opportunity to study under [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]'s tutelage." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I faced an unfortunate battle in Azure. As our resident spellcasters studied maps and attempted to track the Archon of Stone, the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] forced our mages into combat with the local opposition. We were unprepared, and the Chorus 'tactics' seldom aided our efforts." He frowns at the memory.</DefaultText>
