      <DefaultText>"[url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url] is certainly smaller than I remember it, but I thank you for inviting me here all the same." Renata aims a critical eye around [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url]. "I appreciate your help, but we should be done with [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] sooner rather than later. The Sages have enjoyed our neutrality while the rest of the Tiers doomed themselves to shortcoming and failure." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"With Sentinel Stand in our keeping, Stalwart is a step closer to being restored to [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] hands." Mattias beams with pride as he regards those assembled in [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url]. 

"In spite of our differences, our petty disagreements, and whatever challenges are still to come, I am proud to be among you." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] are attacking the Citadel!" 

The breathless runner takes in the shocked glances. "There are gangs of crimson as far as I could see, there must be thousands of them!"</DefaultText>

"[Player Name], what are your orders? I don't think we can just hack our way out of this, but falling back is not an option."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She regards you with an uncertain frown. "It bears recalling that all of this started in earnest when you claimed the Mountain Spire. If you haven't already, I would look into the other Spires scattered across the Tiers. You might learn something more about this... this influence you seem to cultivate. People will look to you as a beacon of hope, and you had best be prepared for everything that could mean."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Can smell ripe stench of death." Hundred-Blood snuffs in Arri's direction before sliding her keen amber gaze to the other leaders - sizing them up as either competition or prey. "Reeks of urine, cracked iron, and fear." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Humans are right to fear Beastwomen. Is natural for prey to tremble in presence of predator. Of own hunter." She snaps her jaws viciously to sharpen her point, and it sounds almost like boulders breaking. "But as Beastwoman has said - [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url] will help humans. Will hunt soldiers from North-lands to survive. Maybe even will help Fatebinder kill [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]." </DefaultText>

      <ID>64</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Did not say stench was bad." The Beastwoman chuffs and scratches one curved claw against the smooth stone wall behind her, marring it idly. "Have come to kill [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]. Will smash skulls and cleave sternums. Will make iron-clads whine and weep. But will give no mercy." 

She bares her long, discolored fangs. They drip with slick saliva.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She sighs and looks to you with desperation. "Must we work with these creatures, Fatebinder? They're reeking and unprincipled at the best of times. And I think this one has been... defecating on the floor of [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url]." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No word yet, but I wouldn't expect that coward to lead from the front. But if he's absent, that means he's not here to inflict order and discipline - and maybe we can kill the toughest gangs and hope the weaker ones lose the will to fight?
