      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder. [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url] is brighter for your presence." Mattias bows.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Pleased to see you in [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url], Fatebinder." Mattias nods with pride, but looks troubled all the same.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He sighs. "I have been... troubled ever since we settled matters with Amelia and Straydus Herodin." Mattias crosses his arms and taps his shoulder.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Amelia's child was the blood of Stalwart and the North combined. Some would call it... her... an abomination. Others might argue that she represented a new age of cooperation." He frowns. "I don't make such claims myself, but I have to weigh them against my misgivings."</DefaultText>

      <ID>11</ID>
      <DefaultText>"When I consider how close we came to killing Amelia and her child, it puts me to mind of my failings as a leader. I was ready to commit an atrocity, to destroy lives, because I felt I had no other choice." He shakes his head. "Even if the baby may never know what I would have done, I will always know."</DefaultText>

      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I know that... I know it very well. But even though the dust has settled and clear skies have opened up over Stalwart, I can only think of the two who never lived to see them." He shakes his head. "My burden to bear, I suppose."</DefaultText>

      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Perhaps. I suppose it's my duty as the leader of the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] to shoulder the burden of that choice. I can be strong for my people... stronger than I have been." He smiles. "Thank you, Fatebinder." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Hm. You speak like the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url], and I imagine that can't be avoided. All the same, I can't help but marvel that such a symbol was invited into the world, and we snuffed out its potential to bring greatness to the Tiers." He shrugs. "Stalwart has always been a realm built on stories and history. I'm sure we'll cultivate more in the years to come, now that Amelia's has come to an end." </DefaultText>

      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>His mood perks up a little. "A difficult decision... and with your help, I found the wisdom to make a better one, didn't I? Perhaps you're right. In any case, the storms are cleared, so I should spend more time rallying my troops and less time pondering what might have been."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yes... perhaps you're right. I suppose I'm being naive about my role, and how I've always seen it. I must be prepared to do incredible, often despicable things for the sake of my people." He nods with fresh resolve.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>He straightens his posture and nods. "You're right, of course. I have to keep up appearances for my troops and colleagues alike, and right now I'm only putting my misgivings on display. With your leadership and our present mission, I'll be too occupied rounding up the forces of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] to doubt my actions again." He beams at you with pride.</DefaultText>

      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We are still picking up the pieces of our realm and figuring that out. The question on everyone's mind is how closely we embrace the values of the past. Given that they led us here..." He shrugs.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A new Stalwart is coming, and for once we will be dictating the terms of its rule. Tomorrow will be brighter than yesterday, which is the only assurance any of us can hope to find." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>He snaps to attention. "Of course! Now that we've whittled down the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] presence and cleared up the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Storms, we have time to train and prepare ourselves like a proper army. When the call to action comes, Stalwart will stand by you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I found this book - The First Kings of Stalwart - in the [url=glossary:burning library]Burning Library[/url]."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Let me take a look at that." He runs his thumb over the pages and nods. "Looks authentic to me. A detailed history of the Stalwart Regency. A valuable find. What of it?" </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It proves we killed Amelia for nothing. She could have abdicated her throne."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Forget I brought it up. Back to my previous questions."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>He shrugs. "If you say so, Fatebinder. Thanks for sharing, I suppose."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>His complexion pales, and he regards the book with an unsteady frown. "That can't... if it were..."

Mattias squeezes his eyes shut and nods.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You're right, of course. Much of Stalwart's laws were set by precedent. This would have been no different. If I had been more aware of our own customs, why... I could have..." He swallows. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You could have saved her. Instead we murdered her. And her baby." </DefaultText>

      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>[Lie] "It's all right, Mattias. There's nothing we could have done."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yes... yes, let's. What would you know?" Mattias looks more tired and introspective than usual.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>He takes a deep breath and nods, but there is a weight to the gesture that may follow him for some time. "You're likely correct, Fatebinder. You are wiser in matters of legal precedent than I could ever be. Still, it puts me in mind to doubt myself, and the choices I've made to get here." He glances around [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url] and frowns. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yes... we did." Mattias takes on a stony demeanor. "Don't try to hoist the burden of guilt on my shoulders alone, Fatebinder. I wasn't the only one to take up arms against Amelia. NEITHER of us fully understood what we were doing." He shakes his head, as if the words give him no comfort. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Will you not be satisfied unless this truth haunts my every waking moment? Then wonder no longer. Had you never brought this text to my attention, I would still hear the screams of a desperate mother, and the last breaths of an innocent babe. Now please, speak no more of this... I beg." </DefaultText>
