      <DefaultText>The hall is full of hushed whispers - some hopeful, others terrified. You hear your name spoken more than once, and not always favorably.

As you approach, the whispers cease, and everyone looks to you at once.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder... Archon. We know of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' army marching South, but we had hoped... we were under the impression that defeating the other Archons would stem this advance. Is it true what we've heard - that [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces are coming anyway?" 

Doubt, fear and resolve vie for dominion in her shaken tone. Your words will set the mood for the coalition to come.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Beastwoman brays loudly, her bloodlust for battle stoking her into a fiery rage. "Soldiers can come! And can die! [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url] will fight for Tiers-lands! Will ravage and slaughter every last human who would fight for [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' tribe!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Earthshaker bows his head and trembles. "We should never have left the Overlord's mercy... our guild is vulnerable, on the brink of annihilation."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I was at your side when you did what was needed at Sentinel Stand, and I'll remain at your side now. Even if [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] shatters this coalition, we will know that we stood tall before insurmountable odds and did not falter!" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I won't have my guild subjected to slavery again. We are [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' toys no longer." She nods to you. "We are willing to die for this coalition, come what may." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Now is not the time for us to crumble into despair! Listen to me, the Archon is going to... the Archon..." 

Arri tries to make her voice heard above the rabble, but she lets it drown her out - looking as dejected and hopeless as any of the others.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The room grows hushed again as everyone studies you, your words finding a place in their imagination that had not existed a second before.

Arri speaks up with care. "Do you... intend on issuing this [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] on the Northern Empire? Is that your plan?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't want to get ahead of myself, but I think this is the first time I've felt truly... truly... optimistic of our chances." A cautious smile flickers to her face. 

"To send the magic of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] back upon the North... it could change everything. Just imagine what people will say!"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Arguably, the law of the land is the most effective change that [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] brought to Terratus. If you would bring a more favorable version to the Tiers, I think it could only help us." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This realm needs our intervention, and we need a structure that binds us together. Unifying our definition of justice under a single banner is the organized approach."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I don't know why I didn't think of it myself: a centralized code of law put together by the best of us to govern the rest. We need something to rally behind, and this might just be it." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Beastwomen do not obey humans. Do not bend or bow to whimpers and whines."

She scratches at a puckered, purple scab. She picks it free and then eats it.

"But Hundred-Blood's tribe WILL listen to Fatebinder. Will follow commands called laws if that is what Fatebinder desires."</DefaultText>

      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"So be it, then. Archon, I only hope you know what you're doing."

      <DefaultText>"Oh, you make a good plea, but what good is it against the forces of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]? What good are any of us without a plan, a solution?!"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Easy to say that now, but could any of us have seen annihilation cresting the hill to meet us here? Because I didn't!" 

Her brow furrows in anger. "We were swept up by you... a soldier gone rogue in the Overlord's hierarchy, dismantling the very conquest you visited upon our heads. It all sounded so promising, how could we refuse?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You have strong feelings about justice, which you're owed as a member of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s court." She frowns. "But your proposal rings strangely in my ears. Something about it feels... wrong." </DefaultText>

      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Our fates have been chosen by the will of distant powers. It's time to take back control and determine our new course forward." She nods. "Well spoken, Archon." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That sounds like a fair prospect. You've seen no small part of the Tiers. If the best of this realm hadn't rubbed off on you already, I doubt we would stand here in [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url] together." She smiles.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Intimidation from [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] tends to be full of glamor and showmanship, like someone trying to get a message across to a dullard. At least your signature terror is unique and subtle." She thinks for a moment and shrugs. "Subtler."</DefaultText>
