      <DefaultText>"You're a fool if you think you can win this war without the support of mages. Do you think [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] conquered Terratus with the force of arms alone?" Mattias glowers at Arri. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You would invite those warmongering introverts to our coterie?" Radix crosses his arms, glowering at Arri and Zdenya. "The [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] are keen fighters, I grant you, but try and see reason. They slew my brethren by the dozens in the conquest. I also have it on good authority that they don't work well with others. They're a sulking, brooding bunch when they don't get their way." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No matter how you paint it, this coalition has a blind spot in its defense against [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' armies, who employ the likes of Blood Chanters and Earthshakers. The Sages at the [url=glossary:burning library]Burning Library[/url] haven't bent the knee, and their guild is in decline. Both the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] and the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url] have worked with them in the past, and know well the value of their wisdom." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We should pursue an alliance with the Earthshakers.

We always told each other if we had to speak about dire matters and worried we're being observed, we'd use the phrase 'I'd sell my left arm for some sableroot wine' and reply with 'sorry, I shared the last of mine with the Beasts.' if it's safe to talk."</DefaultText>
