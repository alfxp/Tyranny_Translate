      <DefaultText>"Bringing some order to the Well has given us the opportunity to regroup and consider our priorities. When you get right down to it, our collective is only as old as the second year of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' invasion. We have a lot of room to grow, but our roots are planted in shallow soil." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She frowns. "It's a good thing that we've galvanized the rest of the Tiers to strike back, because what we have on our own wouldn't carry this rebellion without help." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Our way of life is depending on that hope. We broke the siege, but we can't take back the realm without a unified front against [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You're right. Here I stand doubting our chances, but the people have taken hope from our meager rebellion. That has to mean something, right?"

      <DefaultText>She flashes an anxious smile. "It was a gamble, but I'd say you've exceeded our expectations so far. Keep it up and one of these days maybe I'll sleep through the night." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her tone dips, and she struggles to meet your gaze. "I probably don't say this enough, but the fact that you're part of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s court has done more for the rebellion than any number of swords or shields."

"It shows the people that [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' offensive is weaker than they think. The Archons don't have their affairs in order, and the conquest they thought so close to finished is splitting at the seams."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So, thank you. When we tell our grandchildren about how we almost bowed to a tyrant's rule, you'll always be the one who steered the course of events for the better."
