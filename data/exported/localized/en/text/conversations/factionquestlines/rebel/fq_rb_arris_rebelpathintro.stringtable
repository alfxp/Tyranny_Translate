"During the conquest, [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] exploited the waterways to transport iron from the forges to the front lines of the war. Ever since then, refugee traffic and opportunities for trade have made the Crossing more than it ever was or deserved to be."</DefaultText>

"More importantly, it would seem that Zdenya, the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] Master, has been dispatched to the Crossing under secret order. I know you both serve the same Archon, and I can't imagine that makes you anymore the acquaintance than anybody else, but perhaps by your example she may see... alternatives to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' rule. If she turns, her guild will follow." </DefaultText>
