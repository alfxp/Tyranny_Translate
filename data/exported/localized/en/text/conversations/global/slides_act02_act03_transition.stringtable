      <DefaultText>A powerful incantation echoes across the valley of [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url] - booming out to the horizon in a voice you hardly recognize as your own. You feel your words coalescing into an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] as they settle over the land.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Shocked and demoralized by your display of power and the ease with which you dispatch their leader, the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] fighters lose their nerve and scatter in defeat.

The survivors carry with them fearful murmurs of the powerful Archon [Player Name], a being of enormous might who can cast an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] with the same authority as the Overlord.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The zeal and fervor that the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] brought to the battle evaporate in the face of your [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] and the ease with which you dispatch their leader. Your overwhelming display of power sends panic and terror rippling through the enemy ranks.

The survivors carry with them rumors that defy belief - the Tiers has another Archon, one showing the power of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]: the power to cast Edicts.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Confusion sets in across the realm. Amid the whispers and misinformation, one fact remains consistent: the Overlord's power has been challenged.

You safely assume that such rumors are making their way back to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You gather a small council of your closest allies and plan your next steps from the safety of your Spire. No sooner do you get started than Calio, Fatebinder of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url], pays a visit bearing an important message...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The high winds of your [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] sweep the air, dashing debris against your Spire. Torrential rain falls, hitting hard enough to bruise bare skin. Lightning strikes the ground, endangering anyone out in the open. It isn't long before the storm begins to wane, slowly falling from a gale to a light rainstorm and after a few days it becomes a simple breeze. Eventually the skies calm as your [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] dissipates, releasing [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url] from its grip.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Powerful earthquakes roll underfoot, the vibrations wringing your Spire like a wet rag, threatening to send it crashing to the ground. Your stronghold slowly settles, the terrain only occasionally rocked by a solid tremor. Over the next few days, the land eventually returns to normal as your [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] dissipates.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Sweat stings your eyes as your [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] bathes your Spire in oppressive heat, its weight felt everywhere in the valley. Slowly, the temperature wanes, turning from nearly unbearable to almost tolerable. Over the next few days, the extreme heat eventually dissipates as your [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] ends, releasing [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url] from its molten grasp.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The change is subtle at first - a shifting of the light, not unlike a cloud passing over the sun. Then the last of the day vanishes like a snuffed candle, replaced by the impenetrable fog of darkest midnight. Morale in the valley declines to hysteria in the wake of mass disorientation. You are dimly aware of the sun's presence, but its rays fail to reach [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url] as the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Nightfall holds sway.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The silence is shattered by an explosion of cackling laughter that fills the valley with its mockery. Soldiers cover their ears and search the skies for the unseen source. As the noise fades, those who heard it take a few shaky steps, or fumble with their weapons. A lack of coordination spreads among the ranks like sickness, to the point that formations break and soldiers wander in disorganized clumps. The [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Malediction has destabilized [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The soldiers rallying by moonlight, who thought themselves accustomed to the darkness, are engulfed by a murk as bleak as their nightmares, as obfuscating as a maze, and chilling in its silence. Formations collapse as the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Nightfall drowns [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces in its oppressive emptiness.</DefaultText>
