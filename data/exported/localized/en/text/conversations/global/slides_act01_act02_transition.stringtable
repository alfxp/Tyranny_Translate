      <DefaultText>With the threat of execution no longer looming overhead, the Overlord's armies turned their attention away from the citadel and toward each other.

Having taken [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url] for yourself, Archon [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] recognized your lawful claim to rule and occupy the Spire.</DefaultText>

The Archon of Secrets instructed his soldiers to respect your lawful claim over the Spire. Though a few greedy stragglers still lurk in the valley, the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] were content to leave your stronghold uncontested. </DefaultText>

The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] made an orderly retreat to their fortress in the [url=glossary:blade grave]Blade Grave[/url], while the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] scattered in every direction - with most heading toward their stronghold in the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url].</DefaultText>

Both armies turned their backs to the Spire - your new, unassailable seat of power. You can feel the Archons' boiling hatred from the pinnacle. </DefaultText>
