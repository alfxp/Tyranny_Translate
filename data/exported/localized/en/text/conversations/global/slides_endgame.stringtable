      <DefaultText>You fulfilled [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' decree and all the Tiers is now ruled by a single Archon. Your former rivals have either submitted to you or perished, bringing the civil war to a close. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Word of your success spreads beyond the Tiers as well. Even the most distant corners of the Empire whisper of the Fatebinder who rose to become an Archon and an Archon whose intervention shattered the conquest, making way for a new future in the devastated nation. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Without the authority of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Archons to enforce the Overlord's vision on the world, the fall of the conquest becomes a great revolution. Warring factions struggle for dominance and infighting is a fact of daily life. Every group insists the situation is an opportunity for the Tiers to rebuild as they see fit.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Uniting the Tiers under the banner of the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] was never your directive, and yet you performed it admirably - consolidating the Overlord's forces under your rule and grooming the Tiers for their place in a new order. The same people who once hurled curses across a siege soon learn to think of themselves as part of a greater whole extending beyond their modest borders.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Though you once professed loyalty to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], popular belief holds that the world cannot support two Overlords and you now represent a threat to the established order. This leaves your future in question, with but one certainty: when [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] retaliates, you will be ready.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Earning the cooperation of the rebel factions fulfilled [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' plan of uniting the Tiers under one banner. The realization of this irony leaves you with many questions about the part you played, but precious few answers. You work to ensure peace in this new homeland, yet throughout your trials, the notion that you are part of some greater manipulation haunts you. Now you lose sleep trying to ignore it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You turned your back on your career in the Overlord's hierarchy, disregarding years of advancement to help people of the Tiers. Your sacrifices paint you as a folk hero, a liberator, and the artisan of future change.

      <DefaultText>By abandoning your decorated career in [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' military, you gave the Tiers room to define the path ahead. The future will not be mapped by foreign ideals or the will of a distant autocrat. It is only a matter of time before the Overlord launches a retaliation. You will be ready to face it. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Casting the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Storms wreaks havoc on the northern capital. The winds whip in a sudden frenzy and toss unsuspecting citizens through the air, dashing them back down in the rubble of leveled buildings.

      <DefaultText>It was thought the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] would never rally under another General, but by enlisting [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] to your cause, you managed the next best thing - controlling the Archon to harness the strength of the Northern Empire. You reorganize their old-fashioned regiments with a new chain of command, placing yourself at its highest authority. The legion's victories spread beyond count and your soldiers train hard, preparing for the retaliation to come. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You earned the loyalty of the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] by subduing [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url]. The mob bosses pledged themselves to your cause, presenting limbs and riches as tribute. Unsuited to peacetime, your personal army continues to swell its ranks through bloody conscription, brutalizing the Tiers and preparing to stand against [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' inevitable retaliation.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>No one expected one of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' own to join the enemy's cause - least of all a Fatebinder. Your arrival at the tiers brought new clarity to your place in the Overlord's authority. You resolved to make your mark upon the world through cooperation rather than conquest.

Your efforts brought together the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url], the [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url], and the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] - three groups with nothing in common except a desire to see [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] removed from their lands. With this alliance, you brought down the Archons that opposed you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Neither of the Archons charged with conquering the Tiers impressed you enough to follow their lead. You ultimately defied your orders, seeing a better way to gain control. Eliminating every Archon who dared stand in your way, you carved your own seat of power in the Tiers, keeping yourself independent from the Northern Empire.</DefaultText>

They pledged their devotion to you, hoping to gain your favor. In the months following your victory, emissaries of the surviving gang bosses present offerings and totems of fealty. But without a devoted taskmaster to keep them in line, their flimsy power structure collapses, reducing the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] to a whisper of its former strength.</DefaultText>

The foundations of once-proud buildings fracture under some unseen pressure, and whole districts empty as the city's infrastructure crumbles. Laborers brought in to repair the damage find their work undone hours or even minutes later. Citizens leave the city a ghost town, and whisper among themselves how [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] could allow such a curse to infect their homeland.</DefaultText>

The northerner remains dedicated to the oaths he has sworn you, drilling your forces and commanding them on the field. If he isn't exactly loved by your troops, he at least holds their respect.

In the rare times of calm, he takes leaves of absence from your service, scouring the [url=glossary:blade grave]Blade Grave[/url] for the fallen sons and daughters of the Northern Empire and laying them to proper rest.

Barik sometimes disappears for weeks without warning, always returning more morose (and muck-covered) than he left. The spy you send to track him on one of these excursions reports that he wanders the path of the Conquest, laying to proper rest his fallen [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] comrades.

He journeys the most shadowed recesses of Tiers, recovering (or, at times, liberating) those scrolls and volumes that have survived the ravages of conquest and adding them to his growing library.

As the months pass, reports from the wildest edges of the Tiers present a familiar picture: a growing gang of young and disaffected women flocking to Verse's banner to learn the arts of murder. Though it acts largely without your input, the Callous Sisterhood becomes synonymous with your wrath, a nightmare storm of furious bronze and burning arrows. 

Sometimes you wonder if Verse serves your interests at all, or whether a bloody reckoning awaits the two of you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>While never vocal supporters of the Beastwoman's guidance, Jaspos and Wagstaff continue to provide purified water, each by their own discrete methods. Over time, the Wound becomes somewhat less polarized, and the two men even manage to enjoy the occasional friendly conversation.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Jaspos and Wagstaff finally find common cause - critiquing Reef-Talon's leadership. Far from uniting them, however, it only further polarizes the settlement, each of the mages moving once again to solidify a base of power from which to claim authority.</DefaultText>

Over the course of weeks, the human refugees grow ill, withering as they fail to keep down food. Some flee, others die, but in the end, only Beasts remain. Reef-Talon gathers her tribe and guides them deeper into the Oldwalls, leaving the settlement abandoned.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Just as the Wound begins to thrive, however, Reef-Talon breaks free of Jaspos' chains. In her fury, she tears through the settlement, slaughtering her former Woundkin tribemates and any humans who raise arms against her. Those humans who remain receive perhaps the worse fate, as the [url=glossary:prima]prima[/url] takes from them their vitality, reducing them to Sleepless and leading them into the depths of the Oldwalls. 

The Wound community vanishes almost overnight.

      <DefaultText>In the absence of his former rivals, however, Jaspos focuses on his personal projects - including constant revisions to perfectly serviceable bridgework - and neglects the settlement's defenses with claims that his mystically-fortified walls will ward off any threat. Yet when the Bane swarm through the Wound, little hinders their bloody work, and afterwards only a handful of Sleepless remain to haunt the depths. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Reef-Talon's attempts to play doting mother to the Wound community prove ineffectual. She tries to establish a sense of discipline and hard work, but her self-doubt sabotages her methods. She never overcomes the suspicions of the rest of the Wound. 

As Wound denizens abandon their patrols or listlessly perform chores, life in the settlement deteriorates, Bane attacks become more common, and people begin to leave.

By the time the old Tidecaster recognizes the danger he's in, Insipid Moniker is sliding a knife between his ribs. The former Scarlet Fury claims the Wound and runs it somewhat like a Chorus gang, her excesses only tempered by the constant advice of her confederate Phoibe.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It doesn't last. As Bane incursions winnow the settlement's patrols, Wagstaff takes an increasingly prominent and personal role in its defenses. For every Bane the Tidecaster and his small circle of apprentices drive away or destroy with their magic, three more ascend from the depths. Eventually the endless campaign overcomes Wagstaff when a massive, writhing entity of sickly green light drags him into the abyss. 

Deprived of the Tidecaster's leadership, the Wound community collapses into infighting, opening itself to further raids by the Bane until nothing remains save a few scattered artifacts of an ephemeral settlement where humans were never meant to tread.</DefaultText>
