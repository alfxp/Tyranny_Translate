      <DefaultText>"I suspect that this barrier is the first of several, and that few of them will be as simple. It would appear the Sages delighted in complex solutions."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So all I have to do is touch this symbol and the barrier dissipates? That was so suspiciously easy that now I'm thinking there's a trap here... or maybe we triggered a warning spell elsewhere? I hate this place."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Can feel heat from marking. Touch to break mystic-fence. But maybe marking will not work for other traps waiting in path."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"See? Every once in a great while, things are easier than I expect. Though, I doubt any other barriers are going to be this easy to bypass."

"Keep that phrase. This is a good sign, if they had NOT secured the Silent Archive, they wouldn't have bothered to leave pass codes for any returning Sages."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, this looks cut and dried. Touch that symbol and see what happens!"

"Although I'm sure if there's another barricade, we're not going to have this easy of a time. Let's look for more of those books."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So we're touching symbols now to make barriers disappear? I don't know if Sages had a flair for the dramatic or if no one taught them how doors work." </DefaultText>
