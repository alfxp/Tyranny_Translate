      <DefaultText>You notice a young woman standing apart from the rest of the Sages. She fidgets and twitches, hopping back and forth from foot to foot, murmuring to herself. Even though she seems energetic, her eyes are tired and rheumy, with dark circles underneath them. She leans against the wall, bouncing up and down on the balls of her feet. Looking up mid-twitch, she catches your eye and calls out to you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You there yes you can you help me out I have so much that needs to get done but I have no way of doing it and I asked Renata for help but she's all business and organization and there's never time for anything with her except 'becoming the leader of the Sages' or something whatever that means and how we all have to come together for one purpose and recover the knowledge lost in the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url] and strength and unity and knowledge and scrolls and blah blah blah blah and I just want to carry out my research and you look like someone who knows a thing or two about magic and I forgot to introduce myself how rude of me my name is Acalia and it's nice to meet you and how are you and please tell me you know at least a little bit about magic."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There's another [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] named Hieronymus and I've been studying his work on Oldwalls cryptography because it's absolutely fascinating he's so articulate and insightful and I met him once he's really handsome too I can't believe I just told you that don't tell him I said anything to you I would just die anyway I was going through some of his writings and I saw something that might actually be something but I don't have enough information yet but in order to see if what I know actually might be something worth knowing I need some more information from Oldwalls writings that I don't have access to but I think I know where they are."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>“I used Hieronymus' research and some archived accounts from explorers and found the location of the sigils I need to continue my important research and they are inside the Oldwalls in Haven near [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] can you believe that they're inside the Oldwalls I would love to be able to visit them and explore inside and see all those old treasures and architecture for myself in fact in my research I found some evidence that says all the Oldwalls might be completely interconnected across all the Tiers can you believe that all those walls and you could try to find a way to walk through them not that you'd want to can you imagine all the Bane you'd have to deal with if you did that anyway if you could find those writings it would really help me out!”</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That's wonderful thank you so much I can't believe it this is the best moment of my life okay so if you'll copy down the Oldwalls sigils I will be able to work with them to get what I need to move on to the next step it's fascinating actually I think magic is deeply embedded in their language though honestly I'm getting ahead of myself now so anyway based on my research the text I need is likely split into multiple segments you should be able to find them in specific chambers on some creepy-looking altars for lack of a better term the writings from four of them should be enough to work with and once you bring them back I'll worry about analyzing and deciphering them because that must be mindless and menial and you certainly don't need to be doing that but I don't mind that I love tasks that keep my brain occupied and thank you again!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Acalia bounces and rocks, stepping forward away from the wall and then stepping back to rest against it. Even when she's leaning against the wall, her eyes dart back and forth and she pulls out her notes and reviews them.

"You're back this is incredible I can't wait to see what you found and I guess I'm just assuming you found something because you've been gone for a while and that generally means progress or at least it does for me and I'm just assuming it does for you too but I guess I hate it when other people assume things about me and I'd hate for you to think that all I do is sit here and make assumptions about things not that you're a thing just that you would be in the category of things that I might think about but did you find anything for me?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Wow these are incredible let me get them into better light just look at this I can't believe I have my hands on them now let's see if this goes here and the cypher is a reverse substitution and if you use Randor's index then this would be yes oh wait no that might not what's this and yes there we go wow I didn't think it would be this easy but I can already see the links wait some of these sigils appear incomplete perhaps they were weathered when you found them hmm I remember Hieronymus looking into another Oldwallian construct that might help with this so I suppose I'm going to have to ask you for something else."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There's more I can learn from the writings you brought me but the really important stuff requires some more info that only a field specialist would know so I need you to find Hieronymus and gather any data that he might have on these objects he calls Stones of Elucidation and I can't believe you get to talk to him he was very knowledgeable and smart and I could listen to him talk for hours and I suppose I did because he was teaching some Sages about a new inking technique once so I sat there and listened to the whole thing even though it was really slow and kind of boring but he had some very insightful comments to make about it but last I heard he left to investigate a Breach in the [url=glossary:blade grave]Blade Grave[/url] Oldwalls in person for some more conclusive findings but I have no idea why he would do that himself I mean we can't go risking our lives when we're the only ones who can solve these mysteries because that's what you are here for right?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You're back that's wonderful! I was hoping you'd come back because I was just standing here hoping you'd come back and there you are and I was wondering if you've considered helping me out because and I think I said this before if you don't help me then my research is pretty much stalled right where it is and that is a very dismal prospect to me but I suppose I could help Renata out if I really had to but she doesn't move fast enough for my taste it's all about scrolls and power and I'm repeating myself aren't I?

      <DefaultText>"What? Oh the talking yeah that well you see - I wanted to get more research done but I couldn't because I was always falling asleep on my scrolls so I had to find a way to keep myself awake so I could get more research done so I found some scrolls and they referenced some herbs that were used to keep people awake and alive while they were being tortured because they were both a stimulant and a curative - the herbs not the people getting tortured wouldn't that be hysterical if it was the people then I would look like such a fool taking all these herbs thinking they were helping but all they were doing was tasting like shit but not actually helping me and I wanted to be able to do more research so I said to myself 'Well, if you want to do more research, you should probably find yourself some of those herbs' so I did and now I've been at this research for almost 2 solid weeks. It's incredible!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Anyway, it lets me concentrate on what I'm trying to decode! 'But wait,' you say, 'how can you possibly be alive after 2 weeks with no sleep?' and I say 'Ha!' I told you the herbs had curative properties, too, so it keeps me healthy and I only have hallucinations twice a week now instead of three or four times a day and I call that progress! But where was I? Oh, yeah, I need your help because Renata - wait I already said that part. I was asking you if you could help me out and I was sure you were someone who knew a thing or two about magic because you look like you've been around and seen a lot. Not to say you look old or anything, I'm a horrible judge of age, I'm just saying you look like you can handle yourself in battle. Not to say that you look particularly blood-thirsty or anything unless that's how you're trying to look then I say good for you because you look just blood-thirsty enough and not at all old but maybe just a little weathered. But do you know anything about magic?"</DefaultText>

I suppose they might I haven't gone around to everyone I know and asked them if they needed your help but I suppose I could do that because then at least something would get done..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That is amazing I can't believe I'm actually standing in the presence of the Fatebinder and if anyone would have working knowledge of magic it would definitely be you I mean you're the one that proclaimed the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] in [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url] and although that really wasn't a very nice thing to do it was incredibly powerful I mean not to say you aren't a nice person you could be a very nice person I guess I've never met you well I just met you and you seem nice enough and probably powerful so that's exactly what I'm looking for so maybe you could help me out because if you could it would be wonderful because I have a lot I need to get done but I can't do it without any help and it would be great if you could help me!</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I guess it's not all bad because we could have a leader who didn't care about us at all although I guess at times it feels like Renata doesn't really care about us but just cares about the knowledge and the power but by extension I suppose that means she cares about us because without the rest of the Sages she wouldn't have anyone to lead but it's still weird the way she handles things and I suppose we could have a dead leader instead of Renata I mean that wouldn't be good at all because then they wouldn't be able to do anything except lie there dead unless they died sitting down and then I suppose they'd be sitting there dead but either way they wouldn't be doing us any good."</DefaultText>
