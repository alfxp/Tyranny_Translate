      <DefaultText>"For a moment I wasn't certain that I could run fast enough to escape in time. We seem to have emerged intact, though I wonder if the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] has fared as well?" </DefaultText>

Eb blinks, her eyebrow rises. "Shouldn't the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] be over? We did everything correctly, right?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Was tough, hot hunt. But Beastwoman did not doubt pack would survive. Now [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' mystic-words are shattered, yep?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Next time you plan on collapsing an entire building down on us, could you give me a little more warning? We barely made it out in time!" She looks around.

"We fulfilled the [url=glossary:edict]edict[/url]. It should be ending, shouldn't it?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I pride myself on surviving close calls, but I'd appreciate a fucking heads up next time! Is the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] through, or did we forget something inside? Because I'm not going back there."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Library stands, and yet we satisfied the terms of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]. Seems like a contradiction, but I'm not one to question the Overlord's magic. Whatever happens next, your guess is as good as mine." </DefaultText>
