      <DefaultText>"While I assumed it would be you who would emerge as the victor in this game, I must say I'm a little disappointed you were able to dispatch all of my men so readily. The fear of death is a great motivator, but causing death seems to motivate you a little more."

      <DefaultText>"Although I suppose it's a little too soon to celebrate. You have yet to retrieve the Silent Archive." She looks across the pools of lava at the platform and shakes her head.

"The intensity of the magic it must have taken to ensure the preservation of that scroll. It's rather amusing if you think about it. They may have stopped the building from collapsing, but they couldn't stop the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] - or the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url]. All they did was sacrifice themselves for a scrap of parchment they're going to lose anyway."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You won the game, Fatebinder. Far be it from me to take the glory from you." She holds out her hand, motioning at the Silent Archive.

"Claim the prize."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Almost as amusing as yours, Fatebinder. Those fools were mere peons. You'll find I will not fall as readily as my underlings. One does not lead in the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] for long if one does not know how to watch for danger. "</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Don't confuse caution with cowardice, Fatebinder. It's easier to assess an opponent when you know what he is capable of. You seem quite capable, but I think you'll find me to be as well. You will not have the Silent Archive."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well played, Fatebinder. Whether you wanted it or not, you competed in my game to perfection." She strides forward eagerly, glancing past you at the newly-uncovered chamber. 

"I've been sending these idiots into this furnace for months to no avail, and yet you've done the impossible in mere hours!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She pauses, scratching her chin in thought. "I suppose I shouldn't be surprised literacy proved useful in getting past that barrier, in a place like this. My men couldn't tell scholarly writing from chicken's scratch." She shrugs. "Lesson learned. And bodies are cheap, anyways."

"It's a shame that your talents can't be put to further use for the Voices." She shakes her head, disappointment evident in her voice. "You've a talent for ruthlessness, you know."</DefaultText>
