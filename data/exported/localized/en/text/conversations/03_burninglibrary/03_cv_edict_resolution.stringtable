      <DefaultText>The air around you begins to settle, and the particles of fire and ash that moments ago stung your eyes dissipate with a chilly gust.

With the Silent Archive removed from the [url=glossary:burning library]Burning Library[/url], the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Fire is extinguished, and its warmth feels pulled into your very chest - a sensation similar to the weightlessness when the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Execution broke at [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url]. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The shape and intensity of the fires leap in your mind. The details of the mighty incantation - the wording, the magical logic of the flames - all are seared in your mind with perfect recall. 

The [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Fire is now a part of you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So much knowledge turned to smoke and ash. Ending the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] can't undo the damage, but perhaps now this place can be rebuilt. I hope future scholars can unearth whatever remaining books and scrolls are still buried within."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I do love watching someone's hard work unravel like an old sweater. If you ever meet [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], ask how long it took to draft the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Fire."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Sages had better shape up and share their knowledge this time. Hoarding it got them here, and I hate to think that history might repeat itself."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"While I'm all in favor of undoing the Overlord's magic, this whole [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Fire couldn't have happened to a shittier gaggle of scum suckers. Still, the fires could have spread elsewhere in time so... you did the right thing."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You know you're just asking for it from the Sages. You're never going to hear the end of it. First the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url], next they'll want you to scour the Tiers for the torn-out pages of a farming almanac."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] fills you with its power, you feel the inferno inside the [url=glossary:burning library]Burning Library[/url] begin to wane. Temperatures start to cool, lakes of lava recede, and eternally-burning fires flicker and fade. It may take time before the [url=glossary:burning library]Burning Library[/url] is referred to as the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url] again, but ending the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] will allow access to knowledge thought to be lost forever.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You feel a powerful pulse of warm energy burst from the Silent Archive. Sound disappears into a deafening silence, your vision blurs, and you are overcome by a dizziness that nearly knocks you off your feet.

Then, as quickly as it hits you, the feeling passes.</DefaultText>
