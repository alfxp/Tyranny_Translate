      <DefaultText>A haggard man stands in the middle of a group, addressing them through clenched teeth. They are lounging in the room, almost completely ignoring him.

"If you can't get in line, I swear I'll leave you to burn in this forge. Do you want that? Just listen to me, and we can all get out of here with our eyebrows intact. They're glowing parchment fragments! How hard could they be to find?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ambush the unsuspecting? A tactic I would expect from the Chorus, but not from those with any pretense of honor."

"I suppose you need to be taught a lesson."

He signals his group to attack.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The man recoils and a look of terror crosses his eyes. "N-no! I only meant it was odd to meet you here!"

He glances as his men, who are restraining laughter at his expense.

"Forgive me, Fatebinder." He attempts an awkward bow, eliciting more laughs from his group. "I figured the Censor sent you to check up on us. Don't worry, we will be the first group to get through that barrier and find the Silent Archive."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I m-meant no offense, Fatebinder! I was just surprised to see you here. Thought maybe the Censor sent more people to find the Silent Archive." He opens his mouth again, seeming about to say something, then closes it again with a loud clack.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Another group looking for the Silent Archive? Why would she send more men down here? There are already far too many! And what if each one of us finds a piece of the passcode? What do we do then?"

He sighs, looking defeated. He then remembers you're still there and stands up straight. "Well, don't think it's going to be easy for you to find it! The Censor sent us in first and we don't aim to disappoint."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He looks at his men, who stare back blankly. "I assumed you knew. Why else would the Censor have let you in?" He shrugs, absentmindedly scratching his armpit. "She's put us in here to compete. We're supposed to find the Silent Archive - and isn't it just like the Chorus to have a contest that gets a score of decent soldiers killed."

"Which is why we're bent on finding the Archive first."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He glares at his crew. "Rather, we WERE bent on finding it. This lot are squeamish as babes who don't want to singe the hair on their toes."

"Haven't even found a single piece of the passcode. We blocked the passage so no one could follow us and then they sat down and refused to move!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He scratches his head in contemplation.

"I always assumed I was meant for something better than this pile of shit. Anyone can be a leader, but it takes a real man to be his own master. I will find the Silent Archive by myself."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Damn it Fatebinder, what are you doing?" Ulsten says as he draws his weapon.

      <DefaultText>He notes your approach and calls out, shooting the rest of the group an admonishing look.

"Fatebinder! What are you doing here?"

He looks back at his gang. "I thought you fools blocked the passageway!" One of his men snorts and shrugs then goes back to ignoring him.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's the heart of the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url]. They say the most valuable records are stored there - books that only the senior Sages knew about before the cataclysm."

      <DefaultText>"The Archive is said to have some magical properties, too," Ulsten frowns. "Supposedly, the Archive is the sole reason the Library is still standing. I dunno, we're just looking for it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Two of Ulsten's men look at each other and then at him. "Did he just insult us?" Ulsten closes his eyes and lets out a defeated sigh.

"I didn't ask for this. I'm just trying to stay alive." He suddenly straightens as if he realizes you're still standing there. "Shape up, you worthless fucks!" he snaps at them, then looks back at you.

"I will find the Silent Archive even if it kills me!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Of course you will. A disorganized group of malcontents led by a man who can't even keep control of them. That's some real competition, I tell you. I'd be surprised if you made it out of this room, let alone to the archive."</DefaultText>
