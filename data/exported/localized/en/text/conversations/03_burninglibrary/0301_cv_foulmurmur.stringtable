      <DefaultText>A twisted man leans over two forms on the ground - one a robed figure covered in bruises, the other a soldier, horribly burned, lying motionless to the side.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The man grunts at you with obvious displeasure.

"If it isn't the betrayer himself." He spits. "If you want anything here, you need to meet with the Censor. She's to the east, by the ruin's entrance. You should go. Now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The bloodstained man flashes a gap-toothed smile. 

"I would welcome you properly, Fatebinder, but my hands are full." As if that reminds him, he looks down and absentmindedly licks a drop of blood from his finger.

"If you are here on business, you should speak with our leader, the Censor. Her tent is to the east, near the main entrance to the Library." The robed figure moans and the man kicks him.

"Our troops are making great progress in the ruins below and could benefit from your assistance."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh, him?" 

He motions to the burnt figure at his feet, his tone one of amusement. 

"This pebble-slinging mage thought he could slip past us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He nudges the corpse with his boot. "And for what? To commune with rocks?"

"I grant you that [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] shaped the local landscape in strange ways, but that was no excuse to try and sneak past our camp."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Let's put it this way - the [url=glossary:burning library]Burning Library[/url] isn't the most traditional site for a Chorus encampment. If the best training available to us is live targets, then so be it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The man's pock-marked face cracks into a smile. "I was hoping you'd resist. Let's get this over with." 

Without another word, he rushes you with weapons drawn.</DefaultText>

      <ID>141</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I am the Censor's primary attendant, and I oversee our efforts to access and ultimately destroy the Silent Archive."

"When I'm not managing people, I'm digging answers out of them like worms from the dirt."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He glances at the bodies. 

"I know how this must look, but it's all in compliance with [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s law. If you don't mind, I'm eager to resume my work."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>144</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Good. [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] knows we didn't need her on our tail. The Chorus rewards those who serve."

"We can continue our work in peace now that Renata will no longer be bothering us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So what can I help you with, Fatebinder?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>158</ID>
      <DefaultText>He smiled crookedly, the gaps in his teeth exposing swollen blood-red gums.

"Greetings, Fatebinder. The Censor said I might be getting an assistant to help me."</DefaultText>

      <ID>160</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ugh!"

The torturer wipes blood from between his fingers and regards you with annoyance.

"The Censor ordered me not to attack you. Frankly, I don't want anything to do with you. Leave me to continue my work."</DefaultText>

      <ID>163</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I do. Well, I did. It seems you've already got a taste for blood. My thanks for putting that ink-sniffer Renata in the dirt."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>164</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The Censor wanted to first see that you're willing to help before letting you into the ruins."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>165</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That I do. Though we've captured and subdued most of the surviving Sages, those that escaped the Library are rallying behind their de facto leader, Renata."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>166</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The Censor wants her killed to make sure that any remaining Sages don't get ideas about taking this region back. The trick is finding her."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>167</ID>
      <DefaultText>"As luck may have it, one of our patrols picked up this one." He gives a swift kick to the robed figure beneath him. "One of Renata's own. Perhaps you should 'speak' with him. He's been a rather poor conversationalist so far." He stares at you for a moment.

"Be careful, though, Fatebinder. He doesn't have much left in him. If you're going to try to get some information from him, be sure you ask the right questions."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>168</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I would have suggested that you interrogate our [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] friend here, but..." He toes the corpse. "It's probably unnecessary now."

He pauses.

"Of course, you could still do it for sport."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>169</ID>
      <DefaultText>"As for me, I could use a break. Interrogation is thirsty work. Too many one-sided conversations. You can find me in camp if you need anything."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Fatebinder returns." Foul Murmur gives you a mock bow.

He holds out a red-stained hand, then thinks better of it and retracts the offer.</DefaultText>

      <ID>172</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I was curious when we would get to the fun part."

      <DefaultText>"We're not particularly happy with you at the moment. [url=lore:right_command]We were having such a good time watching the chaos sowed by Sirin's wonderful song[/url] and some of our men owe their positions to it. Who knows what would have happened if you'd let them keep it up." He face twists in a sneer.

"No point in dwelling on the past, I suppose. But some people might not be quite as forgiving..."</DefaultText>
