      <DefaultText>A rough-looking woman stands in the gap made by a broken wall, turning to address you as you approach. "So, the Censor didn't trust four groups to get what she wanted and sent another one?"  She shakes her head.

"More groups... Talk about an excessive use of force." She throws her hand in the air. "For [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' sake, it's still just a library. It's not gonna get up and walk away. We have time to get the Archive! I even know where a piece of the passcode is!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Gaptooth purses her lips, a contemplative look on her face. "True. I'm sure they don't know we're right behind them."

"Not a bad idea at all. Sneak up on them and..."

She draws a finger across her throat.

      <DefaultText>Gaptooth smiles, her snaggle-toothed grin making her look even more insane. "That's fantastic news!" She signals to her men to get ready to head out.

"Since you helped us, I'll let you live." She shrugs. "For now. But watch yourself - if you continue to survive, chances are we'll just kill you later." She and her group head off down the ramp.</DefaultText>
