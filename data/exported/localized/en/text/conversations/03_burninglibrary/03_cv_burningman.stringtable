      <DefaultText>As you approach the edge of the roiling lake of lava, you see a head break the surface. The man lets out a piercing scream and sinks below again. Moments later he pops up, a little farther this time, and floats on the lava, eyes glazed. His shirt is torn and you see elaborate tattoos on his chest as he sinks yet again.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh that... can't be..." Lantry's eyes widen and his jaw drops, "comfortable. I can't even believe it... works?" Though his eyes remain fixed on the man in the lava, Lantry's hands instinctively begin to sketch the scene on parchment. "That sigil on his chest - it's actually working!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You wait until he floats back to the surface of the lava. He screams and his arm swings up, allowing you to grab it and pull him to you. Taking a blade, you quickly slice the flesh around the symbol tattooed on his chest, peeling up the edges of the flesh with the tip, making it easy for you to get a sure grip.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you begin to pull his skin off, his eyes pop open and he begins howling - a loud, inhuman cry that cuts through the sounds of eternal destruction around you. As the flesh tears free, his body bursts into flame and you quickly let go to avoid catching on fire yourself.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His body slowly disappears under the lava, but his screams continue for a few moments, fading as he is engulfed.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well now. That was a production, wasn't it?" Finishing the last strokes of his scribbling, Lantry looks up at you wish a sheepish smile. "I don't have enough varieties of red to really capture the vignette, but I think I captured his grimace. Now hold onto that symbol, and don't let the skin fold in on itself, the image might get all distorted and crinkled. Then you would have brutally skinned an immolated man for nothing."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You wait until he floats back to the surface of the lava. He screams and his arm swings up allowing you to grab it and pull him to you. You drag him onto the rock, and turn him over allowing the molten rock to drain from his lungs.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He sits up and looks at you briefly and then his eyes cast about wildly. "What? Where?" He leans forward and coughs a little.

"I can still smell it. Most of my hair burned off days ago, but the stench clings to my nostrils. I can't believe you found me... I was about to stop struggling in hopes the ward wouldn't prevent me drowning."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It would appear this man has a ward against fire tattooed into his chest." Lantry points his quill at the sigil inked into the man's chest. "Moreover, it would appear to be working... maybe more or less than the owner may have hoped... but he's wading in lava and NOT already dead a thousand times over!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's kept him alive but hasn't saved him from serious injury... if we pull him out, he might... I mean... we could," a cringe spreads across Lantry's face, "take the tattoo - carving it off seems the safest bet - for us, not him, obviously. We could put the sigil to use and... it might be the merciful thing."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"One of the newer scribes. Not sure I rightly know. Perhaps it's for the best - hard enough to see him in that state, can't imagine someone I care about in that sort of misery."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My hunch tells me he was trained enough to recognize that sigil, but foolish enough to overestimate its utility. Such a waste."

With a smile, Lantry clears his throat, trying to sound upbeat. "But he made his contribution to arcane lore - he field-tested the sigil. We know it... mostly works."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Learn? This was drawn on me by my master's hand - an experiment in preservation magic a year or so before this whole [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Fire nonsense began. 'It's for your own good!' he shouted at the time... hate it when he's right. Hated even more when he hurled candles at me to test his magic."</DefaultText>
