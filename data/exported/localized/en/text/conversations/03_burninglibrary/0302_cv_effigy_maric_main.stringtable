      <DefaultText>Maric looks dismayed. "So [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] sent someone to finish what I couldn't do. I knew I had failed my mission, but I didn't know I wasn't going to be given a chance to redeem myself."

"So be it. There is no point in mourning what I cannot change. As for your problem - I wish I could help you, Fatebinder, but at present, I can't even help myself."

"Not only did you sell us out to the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url], but you used our Oath Bound connection against us. In all the history of the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url], I never heard of a more despicable crime."

He pauses. 

"Jelena caused the deaths of some, but only for the sake of sparing others. When you frame it that way, she did indeed rely on the strength of her brethren, and there is no action more [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] than that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That sounds reasonable to me. Jelena made a calculating move with the right intentions in her heart, but it could just as easily have gotten us all killed."

      <DefaultText>"Unfortunately not. All I know is that all the forbidden lore in the Library must be destroyed. [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] believes that destroying the Silent Archive will achieve this, but with the barrier protecting it, no one can get to it. At least, it seems no one has gotten in yet. Otherwise, the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] would have ended."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Thank you for your assistance. I can finish anything else in the Library that requires the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]'s attention while you return to [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url]. I will send him my full report as soon as I'm able. Should you need any assistance in the future, you have but to ask."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Maric has been joined by members of his unit - two weary-looking Oath Bound with large patches of ash and blood blanketing their armor. They nod to their commander as they approach, a curiously nonchalant reaction to his rescue. Maric appears to regain some strength at the sight of his men. He beckons vigorously as you approach, a determined expression visible on his face.</DefaultText>
