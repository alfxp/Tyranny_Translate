      <DefaultText>"Ah, if it isn't the Fatebinder of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]. What an unexpected surprise! I am the Censor and welcome to my camp. It's good to see a familiar face."

      <DefaultText>"Stay your weapons. This is [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s Fatebinder." 

The Censor makes a swift motion to her soldiers, then pauses to look you up and down.

      <DefaultText>"Our scouts have reason to believe it survived. Some magic keeps the library from being swallowed by fire, so perhaps it, too, protects the Silent Archive."

The team who completes the passcode, gets through the barrier, and gains access to the Silent Archive will face glory and reward. The others?" 

She draws a finger across her throat. 

"Only one is allowed to succeed. If you wish to join the merry hunt, you will be yet another team racing against the others. Though you won't be getting any Sages, of course."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Sages went to great lengths to prevent the Library from being swallowed by the fiery deluge, and it wasn't just for a few dusty tomes. Whatever the Archive houses must be valuable. If [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] can't have it, we'll make sure that the Sages can't reclaim it either." 

"Right?" She aims a hard look at the Sages standing bowed.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So far, they have yet to make a notable dent in our efforts. They don't particularly concern me."

Her expression darkens. 

"A meddlesome scout leader - Maric - did cause my forces some trouble when he tried to infiltrate the Library. He was very nearly killed in the effort, so I doubt that I'll be hearing from him anytime soon."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Maric and his Oath Bound troops raided the ruins together, but we managed to capture one of them - a woman named Jelena."

"Foul Murmur spent some time 'talking' the facts out of her, and she was obliging enough to give up the locations of her allies. Sadly, Maric slipped our grasp, if only by the skin of his teeth."</DefaultText>

      <ID>103</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We're keeping her alive at present - not a standard practice of the Chorus, I know, but there's a good reason for it. Since she can detect her compatriots using her Oath Bound affinity, she's supposed to alert us if they get anywhere near camp."

She shrugs. "And if she doesn't, we'll kill her."</DefaultText>

      <ID>104</ID>
      <DefaultText>She presses her eyes shut for a moment. 

"Their loyalty to this inferno is commendable, if misguided. No lack of effort on my part has been spent catching Sages by the scruff of their necks as they try to return to their precious Library."

"Their leader, Renata, is particularly bothersome, and seems to have a vendetta against me. I look forward to the day when she ceases to be a variable of concern."</DefaultText>

      <ID>105</ID>

      <ID>165</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But, I would still ask a favor of you. My assistant, Foul Murmur has something he needs done. If you would be so kind... He is somewhere nearby. I believe he was recently occupied 'talking' to one of the prisoners."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Censor laughs, the sound hollow and absent of any mirth. "Why? It's not as though you're going to be able to do anything with the information." She moves closer to you. Her rank breath caresses your cheek as she speaks to you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I believe the Silent Archive, at the heart of the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url], was never destroyed." She says this almost conspiratorially. "If that's true, it would explain why the [url=glossary:edict]edict[/url] is ongoing." She points toward the entrance in the mountain wall.

"If someone were to get down there and remove the Silent Archive from the library, I'm willing to wager it could be used to fulfill [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' will."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Censor's entire countenance falls and she rocks back onto her heels, looking as if she's trying to shy away from your words. "He...what?" She is silent for a moment then continues, a false happy tone to her voice.

"Well, then. I could use a change of scenery. My eyes have practically melted from watching lava flow." She looks down. "Farewell, Fatebinder." There is now a finality to her tone. "I hope to see you back at Cacophony."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Your choice [url=lore:bl_lost_to_mountains]not to send our troops to clean up the mistakes of the Disfavored[/url] resulted in my crew having a few extra bodies to it. I suppose I owe you my thanks for that." She makes a small bow to you.

"You might fight it interesting to know that the bodies of that troop were recently found but my men haven't had time to fully scavenge the area. You might find something interesting out there, if you're so inclined to take first pick of the spoils." </DefaultText>

So, thanks for that." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh, and I would watch yourself inside, Fatebinder. Your timing on the enacting the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] could not have been more perfectly timed." She titters happily.

"Because the Sages had practically no time to prepare for the destruction, there are quite a few areas that were completely covered in lava. It's a shame we had to lose all those precious treasures, but every war has its casualties, doesn't it?" She laughs again and waves you away.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>While she is speaking to you, one of the Horde approaches her with a parchment held out before him. She takes it from him, her head never turning to look away from you. There is a brief flare of bluish light from her hand and she hands the parchment back to the Horde.

"Stop bringing me words I've already taken or I will have your head." She speaks slowly, still looking at you, but with every word, the Horde pulls back as if he is about to be struck. "Put them in a separate pile so you know I've had them or ask someone to read them to you. If I have to take in the same inane missive one more time, you will regret it." The Horde backs away, murmuring apologies profusely as he does.

She addresses you again. "I'm sorry you had to witness that. Now, where was I? Oh, yes - the Silent Archive."</DefaultText>
