      <DefaultText>Renata folds her arms and looks at you incredulously. "Well, considering he was probably sent to finish the job the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] started, which would mean you're probably here to check up on him, why ever would I let you do that?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Renata smiles and points south toward a house with a [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] and Beastman standing in front of it. "He's here all right. He's our captive and he isn't going anywhere."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't know a lot about the specifics of the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url], but I have been studying it. The [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]'s wording was specific about removing all the forbidden knowledge from the library. I know what [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] meant when the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] was issued, but I think I know a way of fulfilling it."</DefaultText>

      <ID>120</ID>
      <DefaultText>"[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] considers all knowledge forbidden, so the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] was intended to punish anyone who seeks knowledge. The Sages, however, supported the free exchange of information, so nothing was forbidden, except for one thing - the Silent Archive."</DefaultText>

      <ID>128</ID>
      <DefaultText>A look of terror flashes over Renata's face. "No! You must not do that!"

"If the Archive were physically removed, the entire library would collapse around you. The only thing keeping the structure standing is the spell currently using that scroll as its focus!"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>136</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A very important item to the Sages. With our group in chaos, there is no one in charge and we are floundering. The person in possession of the Eye is considered the one in charge. If I can get my hands on that, I could fill the vacuum and bring the Sages back."</DefaultText>

      <ID>201</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Thank you so much, Fatebinder! With the necessary leadership, the Sages will be far more powerful. If we can properly organize, I daresay that - with me in charge - we could surpass the power of the previous group."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ah, Fatebinder, how good of you to return. Folant just arrived and told me of your hand in his rescue. I cannot thank you enough for your hand in this matter." She holds out a stack of papers, shaking them at a nearby [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url]. He jumps, running over to take the stack from Renata, then backs away, disappearing around the corner of a nearby building.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you approach, you see a stern-faced woman having a heated discussion with a frightened young man. She holds a piece of paper in her hand and punctuates every few words with a pointed tap on the sheet. The young man turns bright red and takes two shuffling steps backward, his eyes casting about for help from the group but no one gathered will meet his gaze.

Finally, the woman throws the paper at him and says dismissively, "We are done here."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>219</ID>
      <DefaultText>The young man makes a couple of frantic grabs at the paper before finally securing it, then turns and runs away, tripping as he goes. The woman squeezes her eyes closed, sighs, and puts the palm of her hand against her forehead, working it around in small circles. She takes another deep breath and then turns to face you.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>248</ID>
      <DefaultText>Renata looks to where the young [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] disappeared behind a building. "We are..." She pauses and looks up thoughtfully. "How do I say this diplomatically? We are rather short-staffed at the moment and certain...aspects of my day-to-day life are more difficult than I would hope."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>249</ID>
      <DefaultText>She glances at you, a look of distaste clouding her face. "Because [url=lore:bl_lava_level]we didn't have quite enough time to evacuate before our...home was destroyed,[/url] we lost many good men." She smiles stiffly. "But that's all in the past, isn't it?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>250</ID>
      <DefaultText>She considers you, her lips pursed. You can see she is choosing her next words carefully. "[url=lore:bl_lava_level]Because you gave us warning,[/url] we were able to get a lot of important books and people out before our home was destroyed. For that, I thank you." She sniffs, her eyes briefly looking down. When she looks up again she is composed, all sense of sentiment gone from her demeanor.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>258</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Because [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] saw it fit to have our home destroyed, it is taking some people longer to adjust to their new surroundings than others. But that is not the point of your visit.</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>369</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The Archive is the sum total of [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] knowledge. It is our greatest creation, a scroll of limitless information that can rewrite its contents. You need but ask it the right questions."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>370</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The loss of anything else in the Library is tragic, but the Silent Archive is irreplaceable. The [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Fire would have flooded the Archive with lava but some of the Sages were able to stave it off with a powerful spell. The spell is sustained by the Archive itself."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Why is the Silent Archive valuable?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>373</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Even though the Archive is remarkable in its own right, I can't even properly convey to you its significance. It is more valuable than a library the size of a city. I'm sorry I cannot divulge any more details, but that should be sufficient to emphasize its importance to our cause."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We recently captured an Oath Bound and are holding him here, hoping we can get some information about the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] in the area."

      <ID>437</ID>
      <DefaultText>"On top of that, a lot of the Sages have scattered across the region. We could use more of them here, but we don't have the bodies to spare to gather them up."</DefaultText>

      <ID>469</ID>
      <DefaultText>She gives you a half-bow. Her face is stoic and no longer shows any signs of frustration, "Fatebinder. You honor us with your presence. My name is Renata." She makes a small gesture of salute. "I am sorry we are not better prepared to receive you, but we have had our hands quite full recently." She waves a hand dismissively, shooing away the old subject before starting on a new one. "However, you are not here to talk of such matters, and I am certain we can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She gives you a half-bow, her face stoic and her voice flat. "Fatebinder. The last thing I expected here was a representative of the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]. My name is Renata. We are not properly prepared to receive you as we have recently taken a prisoner and he has proven to be quite the handful."

      <DefaultText>"I will admit I had my doubts, Fatebinder. Tales of people's deeds and accomplishments are always exaggerated and legends never live up to the stories told of them. So when you said you would help us, I assumed I'd never see you again. And yet here you are."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Renata gives you a confused look. "Seriously? That's no small task, Fatebinder. They have taken control of the grounds and I don't even know if you can get to the Silent Archive." She chews the side of her mouth, thinking.

"Okay. If you are serious about doing this for us, the Sages will join you to stand against [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]. We have had nothing but pain and destruction at the hands of the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] and [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] and I would be happy to return their kindness tenfold."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Cute, Fatebinder. But badgering me with the question isn't going to get me to change my answer. As long as the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] control the Library and the Silent Archive is in danger, I am staying here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh, and one more thing. The Silent Archive is the focus for the spell that is keeping the Library from collapsing. You can't simply take it from its home. A suitable substitute must be put in its place. The chamber where it is housed was used as a storage place for powerful artifacts. If you search in there you might find something that could be used to take the place of the scroll."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Renata pauses for a moment. "Although I have a matter I would like to address. When the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url] was under siege, why did you feel it necessary to [url=lore:bl_sirin_song]muzzle my fellow Sages[/url]? If they escaped, what was so wrong with that? [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] had issue with the knowledge we had stored, why punish its caretakers? Especially since they were already in fear for their lives!" She puts up her hand and shakes her head.

"Never mind. Don't. I am not sure I want to hear the answer. I have enough problems on my hands right now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Sages in charge of the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url] changed the runes needed to deactivate the barrier every week. Only a specific few were told the actual sequence. They said it was to 'prevent unwanted eyes in the vault.' I say it's because they were control freaks and liked to make people jump through hoops."

"The passcode was broken into four parts and placed in shelves around the Citadel. Anyone with sufficient skill could find the runes and decipher the passcode, telling them how to deactivate the barrier. That's what you will need to do."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Unfortunately, actually getting the Silent Archive isn't going to be as easy as walking in and picking it up. It is protected by an arcane barrier that prevents passage into the chamber that holds it. Once you get inside the Citadel, you'll need to find parts of the passcode."
