      <DefaultText>This [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] soldier sags heavily against her rope, emaciated and weak. Her clothes reveal her to be one of the Oath Bound.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I came here with a unit of Oath Bound scouts and our leader, Maric. We were trying to locate the Silent Archive. When we saw that the place was overrun with [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url], we resolved to destroy the Archive so that its contents didn't fall into the wrong hands."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I crept along the surface while the others descended into the library's depths. As the hours dragged on, I got clumsy. Someone caught wind of me, and a man they call 'Murmur' has been my tormentor ever since."

      <DefaultText>"He was keen enough to know that Oath Bound can 'feel' each other's presence. That makes us powerful on the battlefield, but it's a crippling disadvantage if anyone gets captured."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"To my knowledge, two members of my unit are still alive and pinned down in the [url=glossary:burning library]Burning Library[/url]. I'm in no shape to go after them myself. If you managed it, I'm sure that Maric would appreciate knowing that his troops weren't completely devastated."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"All I can say is you'll find them in the Library. I can't seem to pinpoint where they are. I only know both of them are injured. Tread lightly, Fatebinder... I fear that place is far from stable."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Maric is right to want me dead. I tried to help my unit, but I betrayed them in the process. When this is all over, I'll submit to whatever judgment I'm owed."

"I wouldn't expect you to preside over my sentencing. That you're talking to me now is more than I deserve."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It devastates me to admit that I eventually broke. Whatever else they are or claim to be, the Chorus are persuasive." 

"However... I fed them as many lies as I did facts, betting that the Chorus would busy themselves on the search and give the Oath Bound time to escape. I heard around camp that Maric made it out, but I don't know about the others."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She brightens. 

"I can tell that you're being truthful, and I'm impressed that you were able to pull it off. Thank you, Fatebinder. Once I'm able, I'll return to Maric and face his judgment. Whatever happens, take care of yourself out there."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She gives you a look of pure hatred, and spits at your feet. "He deserved better than to be butchered by [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s lapdog. I've nothing to say to you. Kill me and be done with it. Otherwise, piss off."</DefaultText>
