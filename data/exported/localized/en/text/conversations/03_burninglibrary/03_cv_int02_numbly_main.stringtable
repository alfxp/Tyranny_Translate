      <DefaultText>The man turns to you, his ill-fitting armor straining against his chest. "What are you doing here?" His face takes on a sour look and he shakes his head. "Never mind - I don't really care. We're not going to let you pass, no matter your reasons. This contest is in the bag. If anyone is going to get to the Silent Archive first, it will be me. And if you think I'm letting you anywhere near that piece of the passcode, think again. Someone already tried to take it from me and failed."

There is a conspicuous cough from behind the man, who rolls his eyes and looks over his shoulder.

      <DefaultText>A large, blood-spattered man glares at you in the midst of a pile of dead bodies. "Gaptooth and her crew said someone sent them down to deal with us." He spits a glob of blood and phlegm to the stone floor.

      <DefaultText>He seems taken aback by your honesty.

"Thank you for being so forthcoming, but I was planning to murder you either way. This just makes the decision easier."

He charges you, his men following closely behind. "Die!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I already told you - go back or die. Those are your only options. Because you're not getting past me." He pauses and holds up a hand before anyone can make a noise.

      <DefaultText>His face scrunches with thought. "Not a bad point. We can get the drop on them while she undoubtedly is trying to decide on a course of action."

He signals to his group. "Let's get going."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And I get to see the look in their eyes when the trap closes around them?"

His eyes narrow. "Fatebinder, you're too good to me. If I were a little more suspicious, I'd think you were up to something. But there's going to be a fight sooner or later because I intend on winning this contest. Let's do it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Numbly smiles as you approach, his large frame splattered with blood. "Your ruse worked! That's one less group to deal with."

He folds his arms across his chest. "Now...about you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Since you helped me, I'll help you."

      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Probably Gaptooth. She was right behind us. Worthless fool. How she ever got her own group is anyone's guess. Coward can't even make a decision."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Can't even own up to it, can you coward? You come strolling down here moments after we are jumped? A little too coincidental for me."

He points at you, rallying his remaining crew.

      <DefaultText>His eyes narrow and his mouth turns up in a sneer. "If you've made it this far without knowing what you're doing, I don't think I'm going to give you any more incentive. Now turn back, or turn to worm food."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Enough to help me win. And enough to keep my mouth shut. You want someone to give you a history class, go somewhere else. Just make sure it's back in that direction." He points up the rope.

"Because you're not getting past me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He blinks as your words sink in, then he smiles slowly as recognition crosses his face.

"You are the Fatebinder who declared the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Fire! It's because of you that I even have the position I do. [url=lore:bl_chain_of_command]The Right of Challenge was the best thing to ever happen to me[/url]! If you are part of the game, I will not play. I don't care what the Censor does to me." He points north at the wall of shelves. "There's a piece of the passcode up there. You might want to get it before someone else tries." He motions to the Beastmen.

"Come on. We're out of here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Sirin laughs, her melodic voice cutting through the chaotic noise around you. "You will try and you will fail like everyone else who has dared to stand against us. You will see plenty of 'action.'"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A large man stands with his back to you, gesticulating wildly at the Beastmen around him. He points north, up the stairs at the wall of shelves on the rise. "Go get it, you mangy freak! It's not going to hurt you! That's a piece of the passcode, I just know it!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That was a spell cast by that [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url]." He points at a body near the stairs. "Who is now dead, by the way! So, there isn't going to be any more 'shiny crackly light' to hurt you. Just go get it! The rest of us need to stay here and keep anyone else from getting to it. Go!" The Beastman shakes his head again. The man makes a noise of disgust. "You're worthless! All of you! How did I get stuck with the monster brigade?"</DefaultText>
