      <DefaultText>The [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] sighs and looks up at you. "I wasn't sure that would work. Well, I was absolutely sure it wouldn't, but how was I supposed to know you weren't another one of those gangs? They're everywhere! I've been hiding in the area ever since the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] tore this place apart. You can never be too careful." He stops, staring intently at you.

"You're a Fatebinder!" He coughs, blood flecking his lips. He wipes them clear with the back of his hand. "I can't believe there's a Fatebinder in the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url]!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You're the one that declared the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] here! You know, it's because you warned us about what was to come that we were able to cast a spell to preserve the Citadel before the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] could destroy it. I don't know if anyone got to thank you for that. Kind of backfired on us, though. It didn't stop the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url], it just froze everything in place as it was being destroyed. Preservation is preservation, I suppose."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Must make you a little angry that we were able to cast a spell to preserve the Citadel before your [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] could destroy it. Kind of put a damper on all your grand plans to have everything just stop, didn't it? Joke's on us, though, I suppose. I don't think it worked the way they hoped. It didn't stop the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url], it just kind of froze everything in place as it was being destroyed. Preservation is preservation, I suppose."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Must have really pissed [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] off that we were able to stop the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] before it could completely destroy everything. I'd have loved to see the look on everyone's face when the whole thing stopped. Joke's on us, though, I suppose. I don't think it worked the way they hoped.

      <DefaultText>He shrugs, winces, and coughs up more blood. "Not that it's doing us any good with all the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] in here. Did you see how many of those thugs ran in? When I saw them enter, I knew I couldn't stay in hiding any longer. I had to come in and prevent anyone else from getting in so I activated the barrier by the door."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I came over here to destroy the piece of the passcode so no one could get through." He points at the shelf behind him. "But this one must have followed me. He attacked me and told me he'd kill me if I didn't tell him how to get through." He laughs and winces again.

"You can see how well that went for him."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Please, Fatebinder, you have to protect the Citadel from the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url]. Don't let them destroy it. That piece of the passcode will get you through the first barrier. Find the rest and keep them from those monsters. They can't be allowed to unlock our secrets."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That's okay, I know I'm not long for this world. Don't worry about a single [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] when there is so much more to save. Just keep the Citadel safe. Please."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Motherless bastard!" The [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] struggles to stand, reopening his wounds and causing blood to flow freely down his chest. His shirt quickly becomes a red, sticky mess. "You can't be... allowed... to..." He laboriously works his way to his knees, the grunted words punctuated with pained exclamations. Suddenly, he stops and just looks at you, eyes wide.</DefaultText>
