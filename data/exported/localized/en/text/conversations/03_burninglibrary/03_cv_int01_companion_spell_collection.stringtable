      <DefaultText>"These symbols mean nothing to me. They should burn along with the rest of this vellum inferno. I hope you can read that!" 

Barik squints at the page and shakes his head. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This is an odious reminder of how the Sages do so love their private languages. Sorry, I can't read this cursed thing. We'd need a [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] to translate."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Drawings look like naked humans. If dismembered. And dragged to form shapes." Kills-in-Shadow chuffs. "Hope Alpha knows words."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"How fortuitous!" Lantry exclaims, looking over your shoulder at the scrap of paper you pull from the shelf. "That truly is a part of the pass code needed to bypass the barrier protecting the Silent Archive!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Sirin stares at the symbols, muttering to herself. "It could be...no... Maybe it's...no, not that either." Finally she looks at you.

"There are so many things I know of that this could be. You're a better one to analyze it - someone with a less-specialized knowledge."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My understanding of letters goes no further than how to write a convincing ransom note. I hope you have a better idea what any of this means." Verse dismisses the symbols with a wave.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I haven't been this excited since I learned my first sigils. Truth is, in all my decades at the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url], I never once set foot anywhere near the Archive."

He starts thumbing through the shelf, opening books, flipping through the pages, and shaking them by the spine to loosen any loose scraps of parchment that might be hidden within.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That looks like the final piece! I can't fucking believe it! I'm going to see the Silent Archive! Oh keep it together Lantry, you're going to give yourself a heart spasm..."

With an embarrassed smile, Lantry takes a swig from a vial of ink off his bandolier.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I hope you have the last of the symbols, because buckets of sweat don't improve the reek under my helmet. A [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] would have done it in half the time."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well now it looks like... a more complete set of gibberish? Don't suppose you can read it? If not, maybe we should find a [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] and beat some answers out of him."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Why do drawings enthrall Alpha so? Nothing twitches. Nothing flees." Kills-in-Shadow snuffs, watching you copy the last of the symbols. "Does human understand such scribblings? Beastwoman thinks [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] can."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Sirin looks over the symbols, her cheeks flushing with frustrations. "Why can't I...?" she says, trailing off.

"This is beneath me!" she declares. "Read it yourself. I tire of this."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Verse rolls her eyes as you finish writing. "Are we done yet? Can you read the damn thing? This would have gone much faster with a [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] on hand."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"In the event of a [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] force breaching the walls, the plan was for the last Sages out to enact a barrier over the Silent Archive, while leaving some sort of way back in when it's safe to return. Doubt they'd write down one part of the code but not the other... we just need to keep looking."</DefaultText>
