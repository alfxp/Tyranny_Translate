      <DefaultText>"So, here's some new blood come to feed the furnace. I doubt you'll last long." 

The man spreads a jagged-toothed grin and runs his tongue along the front of his teeth. He stares at you while he does.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Most of the troops think this 'contest' is a death sentence - and for most of them it is. But me? I've had no lack of fun so far." 

He pushes the point of a blade against his thumb and twists it around slowly.

"So. Much. Fun."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I have high hopes of making it out with all my pieces intact. If the Censor wanted this to be challenging, she should have sent people with more drive." He shrugs.

"With the help of my mates and a few Sages, we'll toast the competition into a fine ash, and powder our faces with their defeat."

"And if we find the Silent Archive in the process, that will be good, too."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Did you come back to have fun? Because there are dark corners all over where fun can be had."

"The type of fun that ends in missing fingers or split tongues."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Think a [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] can get the drop on me, do you?"

He studies you with an even expression. 

"Won't happen."</DefaultText>

      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That's how."

He turns his eyes to the second [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] who immediately drops his gaze. "Would you feel inclined to misbehave if you knew you'd be put down the moment you started acting rabid?" He looks at you again. "Our Sages know their place. You help and you obey. Or you die."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Awfully cute of you to try and sneak up on me in a well-lit room." He giggles and points at you. "You're right there!" He laughs for a few more seconds then suddenly stops.

In an instant he goes from ecstatic to petulant. "I'm sorry, did I forget to conveniently glance somewhere else? I wonder how you thought that might go."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ulsten."

Bone Whittler's greasy face brightens with childlike joy. 

"What fun we had together."</DefaultText>

      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Oh, no. That's not going to happen."

He chuckles. "Not at all. In fact, I wonder how the idea ever entered your mind."

"Did you think I'd just...hand you the book? Is that how people do things in your little world - they just give you things when you ask for them?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A practical, if unimaginative solution. However, I have little doubt that you're capable of it. So here - take the damned thing."

"You have one of those faces. I will remember it, as you will remember mine. Be seeing you soon."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He smiles even wider. "Should I care?" He leans forward as if he's about to tell you something confidential.

"I will tell you I don't care about this contest. I don't even care if I ever leave." He sweeps his hands around, indicating the room. "The Censor has given me a wonderful playground!"</DefaultText>

      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Honestly? The only important part of this contest is that only one group is going to make it out alive and I get to have fun dismantling every other group." He smiles, an insane glee in his eyes.

"This is the perfect spot to lay in wait. There's a piece of the passcode down that hall. If someone takes it, they have to walk right by us to leave."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Nothing."

He stares at you for a couple of seconds before continuing.

"In my estimation, if it can't do anything for you, it's not worth your time."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I agree, Fatebinder. I have no love for the Sages, but this man is a maniac. Depriving the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] of his 'help' would be beneficial.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Beastwoman rises up, excited by the threat of violence. "Not just dangle. Will drop, then listen to human's last screams. Yep-yep."</DefaultText>
