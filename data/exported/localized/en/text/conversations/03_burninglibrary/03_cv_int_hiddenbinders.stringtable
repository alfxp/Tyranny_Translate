      <DefaultText>"I can never thank you enough for what you've done for me. Take this, maybe it will help you. I was unable to finish my research, but maybe you can." He looks around warily.

      <DefaultText>"A muzzle to silence any utterance of forbidden lore," Lantry sighs, pressing his hand to his forehead, leaving a faint blue stain, "or so that was the logic. The way I see it, the muzzled ones were lucky to not be slain outright. You can take the muzzle off, you can't undecapitate... well, not to my knowledge."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I like the fancy little gag there." Eb points at the [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url]'s muzzle with a delighted smile. "It might get in the way of using them as pleasure slaves - I could see cutting my thigh on the metal prongs there - but I think the incoherent mutterings are a marked improvement over the usual vomit of lies."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"While I find nearly an almost erotic bliss in harming the Sages, it's just not the same when they're already broken and demoralized." She lets out a long sigh, shaking her head with a sad, distant look. "Maybe I'm just finally growing up."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] backs up as you approach, fear in his eyes. "No! Please! Don't hurt me!" He stops when he sees you and drops his hands, relieved.

"You're not Chorus members!" He looks around. "But they're nearby. I can hear them! I would leave, but they've blocked the exit and I can't open the barrier without the right key!"</DefaultText>
