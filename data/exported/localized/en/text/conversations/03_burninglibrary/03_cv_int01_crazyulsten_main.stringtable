      <DefaultText>"Ba ha ha, I don't know what... ha, I've never been down there, no sir. Never go back again." 

Fat Ulsten quietly gibbers to himself and chews on his nails. He's worn them down to practically nothing, and his clothes are bloodied.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ulsten flinches and pulls back. 

"Bit off more than I could chew."

Shaking his head, he refocuses his attention back on gnawing away at his fingers. 

Though his mumbles are too low to hear, one phrase catches your attention: "the book... found it, I did, but the bone took it back."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You hear Lantry clear his throat as he leans in to whisper. "I'm a bit of a hypocrite looking down on the inane ramblings of others but... I think this fellow up ahead is terminally unhinged."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Before you can say another word, Ulsten sprints away in terror. 

"Aieee! I won't tread near the flames again and you can't make me!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You won't bite?" 

Ulsten laughs as if this is the funniest thing in the world, and then abruptly stops. 

"He took it. I found it, but he took it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I came for the Archive, but I found a torturer's glee instead." 

He trembles as he rattles off his account.

"There was a book - shiny thing, full of promise. I took it, but that black-toothed blackguard wanted it more. Bone Whittler."

"He fed me pain and torment in equal measure until I gave it up."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Nothing! Nothing but pain and punishment! I didn't know anything, but the pain didn't stop."

"HE wouldn't stop, no matter what I said or did."

"He was looking for a book, but I didn't have it. What would I ever do with the likes of a book?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The joke of it is, I don't even know how to read. I'm betting he doesn't either."

Fat Ulsten hiccups and his eyes spin a merry jig in his skull. He sucks his thumb and stares off into space, all but oblivious to your presence. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I came for the Archive, but I found a torturer's glee instead." 

He trembles as he rattles off his account.

"I told him I didn't know anything. I hadn't found anything. Nothing! That black-toothed blackguard didn't believe me!" He whimpers. "Bone Whittler."

"He fed me pain and torment in equal measure until I gave up."</DefaultText>
