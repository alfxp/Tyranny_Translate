      <DefaultText>Fatebinder, 

I've just received word that [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url], and [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] are no more, and the Court has been sundered... I never thought I'd live to see the day - this truly is a fine day to be a Tiersman.

Please join us at [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url] - our victory celebrations are missing the most important guest of honor. And when we're done with the self-congratulatory revelry and fucking, we'll need to figure out what to do next. If you thought conquering the Tiers was a bad idea, wait until you try to rebuild them.

With pride and gratitude,
- Tarkis Arri</DefaultText>
