      <DefaultText>[url=lore:Missive_BledenMark]Kid,

It appears you've gotten yourself into a bit of trouble - but was it treachery or merely a misstep? In the heat of combat, gut intuition is not infallible, I'll give you that. Of course, most do understand they'll be little more than a warm splatter on the ground, should they decide to fight both foe and ally at once. Your saving grace is the Spire's awakening, which has floored even the Adjudicator. However, if you defy the Overlord again, the Court will have no choice but to also openly denounce you. I would caution you to tread more carefully should you truly wish to walk among the righteous and chosen. This path you now skirt is one of darkness and death. Will you keep closer to the light or the shadows, as they say? Choose correctly - or I'll be compelled to kill you as I have slain countless detractors and Archons before, understand?

However, perhaps most luckily for you, as an acting agent of the Court, you still have a chance for redemption. Your penchant for mayhem has brought discord on our conquest and ired our allies. Should you become caught by one of them, my guess is they'll have an interesting punishment awaiting you. Come to an agreement with Ashe or Nerat, and we all would rest easier. Do hurry - if you'd like to live a little longer.

Learn to read between the lines, will you? How can I teach you to run if you refuse to even crawl, hm?

But luckily - for you - I'm feeling particularly hospitable today. Meet me at Ashweald, and who knows, maybe I won't kill you on sight.

      <DefaultText>[url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url], Archon of Shadows and Court Blade,

As you said, I am still within the good graces of both the Overlord and the Court. As such, I have nothing to fear and will not be cowed by your not-so-veiled threats. 

If you have something you wish to say to me, meet me face to face. Or can you yourself not step from the darkness in order to do so?

I'll be waiting,
