      <DefaultText>To my good friend and Fatebinder,

Hastily, I find myself writing (under pain of death and dismemberment) on behalf of one sir 'Octave of the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url]' who wishes to succinctly inform you, and I quote: 

"Boss, my gal Pustule tracked Rending-Hound through Stone Down, but the mutt nearly gored her throat out then fled east, toward Howling Rock. I'd bet my last ring, he's holed up near [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]'s remains."

Always happy to be of service... even when my services, it seems, must go unpaid...
