      <DefaultText>Fatebinder,

It has come to my attention that you find yourself with few allies at the moment. Sympathy for you does live at the Court, though it cannot be voiced at this time.

Your claim over the Spires has become a much-discussed phenomenon. I think you may be interested to know of another in the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url], at Howling Rock. 

If such information bears fruit for you, please remember the contributions of your friends in the future.
