      <DefaultText>Fatebinder,

It has come to my attention that you find yourself with few allies at the moment.  This is, of course, such an overwhelming surprise... who could have ever guessed you'd be so gifted at inciting the hostilities of others?

Snark aside, I think you are in the right to oppose the Archons of War and Secrets - neither of them deserve the benefit of your doubt. That said, it is politically inappropriate for I or others in the Court to be too loud in our support of you... we have the illusion of neutrality to maintain.

Your claim over the Mountain Spire has become a much-discussed phenomenon. I would encourage you to take a gander at the Sunset Spire that towers over [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]. The [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] have toiled in its arcane shadow for quite some time, no doubt you can tap into its magic as you did with the Mountain Spire? It certainly seems worth trying.

When you get to [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url], I recommend you seek out the town Reeve, an older man named Eldian. He's the closet thing the town has to a responsible adult these days.

Good luck, [Player Name]. If nothing else, it has been a joy to hear visitors to the Court curse your name with shaking fists and furious spittle... I'm so proud of you.
