Do you remember your training under [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url]? I remember mine - funny to think that you and I are about a century apart, but to [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url], we are all children.

I'm now the oldest of the Court's 'children' and I've seen much in my time. It's probably for the best everyone assumes I'm old, harmless, and worth shuffling away in the archives... if I were scrutinized too closely, I'm sure [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] would find I've grown lax in my spoiled old age...

Part of why I am where I am is that I've kept my head down - you appear to be doing the opposite. In some regards, this is beyond your control - you were chosen for the honor of proclaiming [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Edicts - twice! To decline would have meant death, but to accept means to be placed on the stage for all to see.

[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' most powerful weapon is not the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url], it's her ability to hand us rope that we willingly use to hang ourselves - never forget this.

There are numerous questions nestled in your request - what is it you wish to know most? Focus your inquiry and I will answer as best I can.

      <DefaultText>Dear Fatebinder Myothis,

I write to you at the urging of my peer and tutor, Fatebinder Rhogalus. He has found himself bereft of answers (a rare condition for him) and suggested you may be the only source of the answers I seek.

If you will pardon the imposition, it would mean a great deal to learn what you know of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Edicts, and the magic of the Spires. The Mountain Spire of the Tiers has awoken to my presence - an event that occurred moments after I resolved an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] - so it's critical that I learn just what has happened to me, and what it all means.

I thank you in advance for your consideration and wisdom.

      <DefaultText>Fatebinder Myothis,

My name is [Player Name] and I recently resolved [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Execution and claimed the Mountain Spire of the Tiers. I am now the master of [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url], and a question mark to many, as it seems awaken the Spire has shocked everyone.

Rhogalus said you were wise and knowledgeable in matters best not discussed in front of the Archons. I seem to have stumbled into ownership of the Spire and feel I should learn all that I can about this monument that is now my own.

If you will be forthcoming with your knowledge, I promise you will be rewarded when the time comes to show gratitude to the loyal.

      <DefaultText>Fatebinder Myothis,

I am Fatebinder [Player Name], and I'm currently serving in the Tiers. I recently broke an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] and in roughly the same breath, awoke the latent energies in the Mountain Spire of the Tiers.

When I told my old mentor Rhogalus of these events, he insisted I contact you, hinting that your wisdom exceeds his own. If that's true, I'd be a fool not to heed the advice of someone more worldly than even Rhogalus.

But I know knowledge is power, and power isn't free. I have enclosed a hand of rings as tuition and tribute - a paltry offering for a respected teacher, but it is a sizable sum to me.

Thank you for your consideration, I eagerly await your reply.

      <DefaultText>Dear Myothis,

Thank you for hearing me out. I have more questions than I have ink, but let's start with a discussion of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Edicts. I've lived under, proclaimed, and resolved Edicts - which makes me far more knowledgeable than the lay person on the subject, and yet I still know so little.

      <DefaultText>Dear Myothis,

It seems wise to know one's own domain, and seeing as I'm now the master of the Mountain Spire, I ought to learn all that I can. If you would share with me what you know of the Spires, I would be in your debt.

I'll start with what I know and have observed so far. The Mountain Spire seemed to awaken at about the same instant that [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Execution was put to rest. There was a burst of arcane energy that drowned out my senses, and I awoke at the summit of the Spire in (what seemed to be) just a few heartbeats of time.

Atop the Spire is an old sculpture of sorts, and it seems to be the core of the Spire's mystic energy. I've been seeing visions and receiving sensations FROM the sculpture - it seems odd to describe it as talking to me, but that seems the closest analogy.

Am I the first to report such things? There are other Spires elsewhere in the world, correct?

      <DefaultText>Salutations, [Player Name]

It is difficult to separate fact from superstition when it comes to Edicts, as it seems only [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] knows how it all works, the rest of us are left to live in fear and ponder it all.

[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] Edicts are a sort of magic above and beyond even the Archons - I daresay the Edicts are STRONGER than [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] as there's no evidence [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] can willingly stop an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] once set into motion... which is, in part, why [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Edicts seem to have an 'until' or 'unless' clause in their wording.

I know the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url], as powerful as it is, requires a human voice to complete the casting - thus the Overlord has people like you proclaim Edicts cast far from the Imperial Throne - the magic is [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' magic, but the human voice is the final carrier or trigger to complete the magic phenomenon.

And here's what's most fascinating - at least as far as you're concerned. There have been dozens of mortal agents who have been made to proclaim Edicts - two-thirds of them die within a decade, and many gave reports of lingering mystic scars from the ordeal.

And there have also been a handful to resolve or break an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] - these 'until' and 'unless' clauses get fulfilled from time to time, and we see a similar pattern in history - those who resolve an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] often live short lives, and many speak of arcane side effects of the shattered Edicts.

Here's where you're unique... to the best of my fact-finding, you are the first to proclaim and break the exact same [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]. Whatever mystical power is involved in the creation and destruction of such magics, you're the first to stand at the terminus of both.

Now that I know the Spires can be awoken, it makes sense that if anything can or would wake them from slumber, a shattered [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] seems the likely culprit.

[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] has other Edicts in place throughout the Tiers. If you truly wish to learn more, perhaps you should take it upon yourself to shatter those Edicts. After all, if [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] did not wish for the Edicts to be broken, why include a termination clause?

      <DefaultText>Greetings [Player Name],

You are correct, there are Spires all across Terratus. The exact distribution of these monuments fuels all sorts of debate and speculation, but two facts seem commonplace: most Spires are built near Oldwalls (your Mountain Spire is a notable exception) and nearly every culture that predated [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] has some local myth to explain the builders of these Spires - I believe the Tiersmen cite the "Older Realms" as their local name for the  Spire/Oldwalls architects... but nobody knows for sure.

And of course, where [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] has brought proper civilization, the origin of the Spires simply isn't discussed in good company...

Here's what I think you need to know...

First, the Spires behave as arcane lodestone - there is a constant field of magical strength around a Spire. If you imagine a mystic sea resting atop our world, the Spires seem to spin and churn this magic - creating a spell cast with even modest effort will materialize with powerful results.

Second, and I'd say most tellingly, [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] has laws against entering the Oldwalls, but there are no laws against the Spires. You could infer from this that means [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] has no issue with the lay folks messing with the Spires but wishes to keep us safe from the Oldwalls. Or you could think like an Overlord and know that if you place a rule against something, you make it forbidden and desirable... now I find it telling that [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] forbids the hallways that leads to the Spires but does not paint a target on the Spires themselves.

Last but not least... as a young Fatebinder, I once had to oversee the case of a man who had built a shrine to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] around the base of a Spire in the far south east. I could find no evidence of falsity or slander - his shrine was a most reverent and loving tribute as I've ever seen. At one point though, this man claimed he had evidence that '[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] was here back in negative fifty.' He had merely uttered those words and my senior Binder swung the axe then and there. Being the new girl at the Court, I said nothing, but I have long wondered why such a comment should require death instead of the traditional removal of the tongue.

      <DefaultText>My dear [Player Name],

And they say respect for one's elders is a dying art form - I thank you kindly for the offering, as I've accounts to settle and grandchildren to spoil, and keeping a low profile isn't very profitable. I have enclosed something for you in return - I do so hate to let parchment collect dust and I figure a younger mind could make use of some of the scrolls haunting my cabinets.

I'm now the oldest of the Court's 'children' and I've seen much in my time.

      <DefaultText>Dear [Player Name],

Based on what you've told me, it seems a stretch to believe these events are mere coincidence or circumstance. [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Execution was a setup for SOMEONE to claim [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url]... to think that [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] did not know what would happen is a massive underestimation of the Overlord's long view.

You have been thrust into the arena of the mighty, your options are: retreat into obscurity, suicide, or rising to the occasion - I suggest the third option.

If I were you, I would use my connection to the Spires to see if they will all awaken to my presence. Every Tiersman sees the Spires in the horizon - if they know YOU are the master of the Spires, they will see YOU each time they look to the sunrise or sunset.

Foster a reputation for power, make others fear you. This is what I've seen [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] and every living Archon do for as long as I've lived and there's reasons for this... there's the practical case that power and a reputation insulate you from threats, but there's the lesser-known element that I can't prove but I know in my heart to be true: the fear and love of others will strengthen your magic.

This last part I've inferred from my discussions with [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url]. In the few times he has spoken of his gruesome work of slaying those who might rise to threaten the Overlord, he has hinted that it's easier to kill the 'rogue elements' before they become famed and fearsome. In my lifetime, I saw [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] change from an unknown militiaman to a fearsome general - and I can assure you, he did not have the power to shield his warriors in those days when he was without title or reputation. The Archons will never, ever discuss the origin of their power (because such knowledge might be used against them) but I have known ALL the Archons to be obsessed with the presentation of power...

Your connection to the Spires will all but guarantee the Archons will want to control and destroy you - it's a question of when, not if. Start thinking and acting like an Archon... as far as I'm concerned, you ARE an Archon - the Archon of the Spires. We are quick to place labels on powers we easily spot - and history is replete with Archons of Fire and Ice - it is foolish to think that there must be a word for a thing before an Archon can control it. Other way around - the Archons show us what is possible, and we must step to their dance.

[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] Edicts are a sort of magic above and beyond even the Archons - I daresay the Edicts are STRONGER than [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] as there's no evidence [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] can willingly stop an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] once set into motion... which is, in part, why [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Edicts seem to have an 'until' or 'unless' clause in their wording.

I know the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url], as powerful as it is, requires a human voice to complete the casting - thus the Overlord has people like you proclaim Edicts cast far from the Imperial Throne - the magic is [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' magic, but the human voice is the final carrier or trigger to complete the magic phenomenon.

And here's what's most fascinating - at least as far as you're concerned. There have been dozens of mortal agents who have been made to proclaim Edicts - two-thirds of them die within a decade, and many gave reports of lingering mystic scars from the ordeal.

And there have also been a handful to resolve or break an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] - these 'until' and 'unless' clauses get fulfilled from time to time, and we see a similar pattern in history - those who resolve an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] often live short lives, and many speak of arcane side effects of the shattered Edicts.

Here's where you're unique... to the best of my fact-finding, you are the first to proclaim and break the exact same [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]. Whatever mystical power is involved in the creation and destruction of such magics, you're the first to stand at the terminus of both.

Now that I know the Spires can be awoken, it makes sense that if anything can or would wake them from slumber, a shattered [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] seems the likely culprit.

[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] has other Edicts in place throughout the Tiers. If you truly wish to learn more, perhaps you should take it upon yourself to shatter those Edicts. After all, if [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] did not wish for the Edicts to be broken, why include a termination clause?

      <DefaultText>Dear [Player Name],

Based on what you've told me, it seems a stretch to believe these events are mere coincidence or circumstance. [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Execution was a setup for SOMEONE to claim [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url]... to think that [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] did not know what would happen is a massive underestimation of the Overlord's long view.

You have been thrust into the arena of the mighty, your options are: retreat into obscurity, suicide, or rising to the occasion - I suggest the third option.

If I were you, I would use my connection to the Spires to see if they will all awaken to my presence. Every Tiersman sees the Spires in the horizon - if they know YOU are the master of the Spires, they will see YOU each time they look to the sunrise or sunset.

Foster a reputation for power, make others fear you. This is what I've seen [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] and every living Archon do for as long as I've lived and there's reasons for this... there's the practical case that power and a reputation insulate you from threats, but there's the lesser-known element that I can't prove but I know in my heart to be true: the fear and love of others will strengthen your magic.

This last part I've inferred from my discussions with [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url]. In the few times he has spoken of his gruesome work of slaying those who might rise to threaten the Overlord, he has hinted that it's easier to kill the 'rogue elements' before they become famed and fearsome. In my lifetime, I saw [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] change from an unknown militiaman to a fearsome general - and I can assure you, he did not have the power to shield his warriors in those days when he was without title or reputation. The Archons will never, ever discuss the origin of their power (because such knowledge might be used against them) but I have known ALL the Archons to be obsessed with the presentation of power...

Your connection to the Spires will all but guarantee the Archons will want to control and destroy you - it's a question of when, not if. Start thinking and acting like an Archon... as far as I'm concerned, you ARE an Archon - the Archon of the Spires. We are quick to place labels on powers we easily spot - and history is replete with Archons of Fire and Ice - it is foolish to think that there must be a word for a thing before an Archon can control it. Other way around - the Archons show us what is possible, and we must step to their dance.

      <DefaultText>Dear [Player Name],

My advice would be to isolate and shelter yourself - avoid the other Archons. Whatever the truth is behind your link to the Spires matters not - all that matters is you have a new, poorly-understood power and that makes you a problem to the Archons - if they aren't trying to kill you already, they soon will.

And for that reason, I must ask that we cease our exchanges - I fear those who are watching my dovecotes may infer the link and bring woe upon one or both of us.

Best of luck, Fatebinder. You will most certainly need it.

      <DefaultText>Dear Myothis,

Thank you for weighing in on all of this. To ask perhaps too obvious a question... if I am such an anomaly, such a threat, why hasn't the Overlord dealt with me right away? An [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] or just a simple request to [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] would be no small threat... neither seems to have happened just yet.

What is your take on this? Why hasn't [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] dealt with me?

      <DefaultText>Dear Myothis,

Your wisdom on the matter is greatly appreciated.

You made mention of [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] and his killings. During my training, Fatebinder Calio hinted that much of [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url]'s work involves killing off threats before they blossom into genuine problems - so it's curious to hear you second that fact.

So... let's say for the sake of argument I AM some Archon... is it just a matter of time until [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] is sent to kill me? Should I be making grand displays of loyalty to the Court to assuage his suspicions?

Your missive made mention of [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] - and how you've known of him since before he wore the title Archon of War. Can you tell me more of what you observed of his rise to power? If I am indeed an Archon, it's safe to say I wasn't born knowing what I can or can't do and it stands to reason I might learn something from the stories of the other Archons.

      <DefaultText>Archon [Player Name],

Allow me to address you by such a title before it becomes fashionable to do - I pride myself as a woman who stays ahead of the trends.

Why [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] smites some but allows others to exist is a question we all ponder. The Overlord can certainly appear arbitrary and if I've learned anything, that's the point... [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] is intentionally aloof and distant - both for matters of personal security and because if you had to wrangle the most powerful entities of Terratus, you'd need to keep them from getting too comfortable.

To me, the most obvious answer is that [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] knows EXACTLY what you are doing - she probably approves of your actions and is likely working at every opportunity to create a situation wherein you are acting in your own self-interest while satisfying her ambitions as well.

You have to consider one important detail: there's nowhere left in Terratus to conquer now that the Tiers are in the Overlord's grasp. What would the great generals even do in a time of peace? [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]The Voices of Nerat[/url] is barely tolerable when you have need of a spy master, why keep around such a monster when you no longer have need of such a gruesome weapon?

I would argue it is in [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' interest that the Tiers be a costly invasion that claims the lives of as many of the Archons as possible - not enough meat on the Tiers to keep too many sharks sated very long.

[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] ordered everyone to take [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url] or die - the 'or die' must have been an acceptable option, correct? If I had to hazard a guess, I'd say you have the unspoken backing of the Overlord - it's not like [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] can't find you whenever he wants.

      <DefaultText>My dear Fatebinder,

It's a poorly-kept secret that [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url]'s job is more about killing threats before they become a problem - 'official' executions are really the minority of his duties.

As I understand it, [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] has long used [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] as a preventative measure. Since he can move about the world rather freely, and he can evade all but the most absurd powers, he's the perfect predator to send against wild talents.

I'm sure few in the Tiers have ever actively wondered why there have been seemingly so few Archons born this far west. I'm sure folks with the potential to be Archons have occurred in the Tiers time and time again - but they're usually cut down by Mark before the world hears of them.

It's likely safe to assume [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] has his eye on you and has orders to use his own judgment as to when to strike. I've known the old man for ages and I'd strongly encourage you NOT to try to appeal to him with overt displays of loyalty - he has no stomach for sycophants. I sincerely believe he thinks every human being is a selfish, twisted knave and there are those who are lying about it and those that accept what they are - no third type exists.

So yes, I do think [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] will one day have to come for you. As I said - you could always hide or end your life now... but where you're headed, conflict is likely inevitable.

      <DefaultText>[Player Name],

This is the sort of question that can get you killed. Very little is known about how Archons are born or come to power - and my long life has taught me that [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] and the Archons prefer it this way... if the young and talented remain forever in the dark, the old and mighty can rule without challenge.

I heard of Ashe (he will always be merely Ashe to me - before [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] renamed him and gave his legion that back-handed title) as a rebel - a grimy, illiterate partisan who was winning battles while his countrymen of the Northern Kingdom lost left and right.

Ashe was always a good leader, but he wasn't born able to mystically reach out and protect his soldiers. The earliest mention of it isn't even until the tail end of the Northern Conquest - and if you read the journals, they don't tell stories of grievous harm warded off by Ashe's stern looks - instead, they talk of his soldiers finding their fears and doubts lifted from them by Ashe's presence. A careful reading suggests the ability to actively protect physical harm came years later, as that bond grew and (more importantly) as his legend grew.

That legend part is the key detail. In my understanding, an Archon's power is something of a self-fulfilling prophecy: the widespread perception of an Archon's power is the very thing that strengthens an Archon's power. So in Ashe's case, he had some early inkling of a power - the ability to assuage the burdens of his men, and as he took on a mantle of power and became known all around Terratus as the next Archon of War, it soon became the ability to bear the physical burdens of his men, not just their fears and doubts.

Thus my advice to you is to act like an Archon - take power where you can find it. Foster fear, foster love - never walk through life anonymously but rather live in the thoughts of your followers and the anxieties of your enemies.

To me, the most obvious answer is that [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] knows EXACTLY what you are doing - she probably approves of your actions and is likely working at every opportunity to create a situation wherein you are acting in your own self-interest while satisfying her ambitions as well.

You have to consider one important detail: there's nowhere left in Terratus to conquer now that the Tiers are in the Overlord's grasp. What would the great generals even do in a time of peace? [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]The Voices of Nerat[/url] is barely tolerable when you have need of a spy master, why keep around such a monster when you no longer have need of such a gruesome weapon?

I would argue it is in [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' interest that the Tiers be a costly invasion that claims the lives of as many of the Archons as possible - not enough meat on the Tiers to keep too many sharks sated very long.

[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] ordered everyone to take [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url] or die - the 'or die' must have been an acceptable option, correct?

This is the sort of question that can get you killed. Very little is known about how Archons are born or come to power - and my long life has taught me that [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] and the Archons prefer it this way... if the young and talented remain forever in the dark, the old and mighty can rule without challenge.

I heard of Ashe (he will always be merely Ashe to me - before [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] renamed him and gave his legion that back-handed title) as a rebel - a grimy, illiterate partisan who was winning battles while his countrymen of the Northern Kingdom lost left and right.

Ashe was always a good leader, but he wasn't born able to mystically reach out and protect his soldiers. The earliest mention of it isn't even until the tail end of the Northern Conquest - and if you read the journals, they don't tell stories of grievous harm warded off by Ashe's stern looks - instead, they talk of his soldiers finding their fears and doubts lifted from them by Ashe's presence. A careful reading suggests the ability to actively protect physical harm came years later, as that bond grew and (more importantly) as his legend grew.

That legend part is the key detail. In my understanding, an Archon's power is something of a self-fulfilling prophecy: the widespread perception of an Archon's power is the very thing that strengthens an Archon's power. So in Ashe's case, he had some early inkling of a power - the ability to assuage the burdens of his men, and as he took on a mantle of power and became known all around Terratus as the next Archon of War, it soon became the ability to bear the physical burdens of his men, not just their fears and doubts.

Thus my advice to you is to act like an Archon - take power where you can find it. Foster fear, foster love - never walk through life anonymously but rather live in the thoughts of your followers and the anxieties of your enemies.

Allow me to address you by such a title before it becomes fashionable to do - I pride myself as a woman who stays ahead of the trends.

      <DefaultText>My dear Fatebinder,

It's a poorly-kept secret that [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url]'s job is more about killing threats before they become a problem - 'official' executions are really the minority of his duties.

As I understand it, [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] has long used [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] as a preventative measure. Since he can move about the world rather freely, and he can evade all but the most absurd powers, he's the perfect predator to send against wild talents.

I'm sure few in the Tiers have ever actively wondered why there have been seemingly so few Archons born this far west. I'm sure folks with the potential to be Archons have occurred in the Tiers time and time again - but they're usually cut down by Mark before the world hears of them.

It's likely safe to assume [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] has his eye on you and has orders to use his own judgment as to when to strike. I've known the old man for ages and I'd strongly encourage you NOT to try to appeal to him with overt displays of loyalty - he has no stomach for sycophants. I sincerely believe he thinks every human being is a selfish, twisted knave and there are those who are lying about it and those that accept what they are - no third type exists.

So yes, I do think [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] will one day have to come for you. As I said - you could always hide or end your life now... but where you're headed, conflict is likely inevitable.

      <DefaultText>Dear Myothis,

I appreciate the insight and am honored by your vote of confidence.

Your missive made mention of [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] - and how you've known of him since before he wore the title Archon of War. Can you tell me more of what you observed of his rise to power? If I am indeed an Archon, it's safe to say I wasn't born knowing what I can or can't do and it stands to reason I might learn something from the stories of the other Archons.

Your wisdom on the matter is greatly appreciated.

You made mention of [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] and his killings. During my training, Fatebinder Calio hinted that much of [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url]'s work involves killing off threats before they blossom into genuine problems - so it's curious to hear you second that fact.

So... let's say for the sake of argument I AM some Archon... is it just a matter of time until [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] is sent to kill me? Should I be making grand displays of loyalty to the Court to assuage his suspicions?

Thank you for weighing in on all of this. To ask perhaps too obvious a question... if I am such an anomaly, such a threat, why hasn't the Overlord dealt with me right away? An [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] or just a simple request to [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] would be no small threat... neither seems to have happened just yet.

What is your take on this? Why hasn't [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] dealt with me?

      <DefaultText>My dear [Player Name],

And they say respect for one's elders is a dying art form - I thank you kindly for the offering, as I've accounts to settle and grandchildren to spoil, and keeping a low profile isn't very profitable. I have enclosed something for you in return - I do so hate to let parchment collect dust and I figure a younger mind could make use of some of the scrolls haunting my cabinets.

I'm now the oldest of the Court's 'children' and I've seen much in my time. It's probably for the best everyone assumes I'm old, harmless, and worth shuffling away in the archives... if I were scrutinized too closely, I'm sure [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] would find I've grown lax in my spoiled old age...

Part of why I am where I am is that I've kept my head down - you appear to be doing the opposite. In some regards, this is beyond your control - you were chosen for the honor of proclaiming [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Edicts - twice! To decline would have meant death, but to accept means to be placed on the stage for all to see.

[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' most powerful weapon is not the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url], it's her ability to hand us rope that we willingly use to hang ourselves - never forget this.

There are numerous questions nestled in your request - what is it you wish to know most? Focus your inquiry and I will answer as best I can.
