Short of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' direct interdiction, I remain the sovereign adjudicator of disputes between any two living creatures protected by [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Peace. I have ordered [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] and [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] to cease all violence - both have disobeyed.

That the two Archons are insubordinate is beyond any doubt. Deciding whether either of them is actively treacherous requires a most thorough examination, for the punishment of death cannot be reversed.

As my agent, arbiter, and deputy, you are above the petty customs of the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] and [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url]. You are not, however, above my law. You still answer to me - and you WILL answer to me at once. Report immediately to the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url] to explain your actions at [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url]...

      <DefaultText>Lord [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url],

My investigation into [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] and [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] will require any and all resources I can acquire.

Perhaps something additional could be directed my way. It would certainly make my job easier.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Lord [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url],

I feel my efforts would be well-spent talking to the soldiers of the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url]. While I doubt those guilty of treason would be forthcoming with the truth, criminals often let their defenses down amongst friends.

If you have it within your capacity to speak to members of the Chorus or send good word on my behalf, any help from you with the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] could assist my inquest.</DefaultText>

What of the growing rebellion that occurs during this time of infighting? Who will silence the growing voice of insurrection?</DefaultText>

I will endeavor to conduct a most thorough inquiry on the matter. I will determine if one or both are guilty of treachery, or if the fight between the two was instigated by some third force.

As always, I am your twin hands of justice and accord.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Well hello [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url],

My understanding, which - in all fairness - is limited to what you have taught me, is that you are the Archon responsible for keeping [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Peace. [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] and [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] might claim the ground, but yours is the burden of pacification.

So instead of asking me to investigate some treachery, let's just call it what it is - I'm helping you cover for your inability to notice dissension in your allies until it's too late.</DefaultText>

I will have funds requisitioned and sent along with this missive - you will no doubt need some rings to conduct business, provision help, and coerce the obstinate.

You are now a rather important target to some. Speak with Lohara, one of the master [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url]. As of this writing she is in [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url], overseeing [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' armory. Tell her I am calling in her settlement on your behalf and that she is to armor you for war. If she claims ignorance, remind her that the original punishment of dismemberment can still be enforced...

The [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] is more a river than an organization. Lives shuffle in and out with no guarantee that any one member will remain in one place - or even alive - long enough to make a difference. However, there are a few gang captains that have run afoul of my law of late that showed a willingness for penance. I sent them back to camp with instructions to speak well of the Fatebinder of the Spire. I cannot guarantee this will accomplish much. If you wish to earn the respect of the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url], you must take it - serve their needs or impress them with your strength. Asking, requesting, or debating is often a losing proposition with those fully enamored with the Chorus mindset.

Do not imagine any favor will cause their reception of you to become favorable if you have otherwise garnered their ire, Fatebinder. I have done what I am able. The rest is up to you.

I would still be wary

      <DefaultText>Lord [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url],

I need to speak with members of the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] to learn their side of events thus far.

The legion seems to be insular and tightly-knit. While this seems useful and necessary for war, it results in silence and lies of omissions when I ask questions.

If you are able, my lord [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url], please put in a good word for me, A positive rapport with the legion would greatly aid my investigation.</DefaultText>

I have sent word directly to [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url], informing him that you will be my chosen agent on recent judicial matters.

I have vouched for you character. However, do not think that mere words are enough to cause them to stay their hand if your actions have incited war in their hearts. My words carry weight, but your deeds will stay in their minds for much longer.

If you wish to gain the trust of the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url], you will need to earn it - I cannot assist.

Try to appeal to the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]'s sense of honor, duty, and tradition. Be mindful of their arrogance - they are easily offended by perceived slights to their greatness.

I have no doubts about your loyalty. Your results, however, remain in question.

It is imperative that we do all we can to cease hostilities between the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] and the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] - and waiting for one side to annihilate the other, while technically a solution, is also dereliction of duty.

Endeavor to understand and judge fairly.

Your tone may be puerile but you include a salient point - it falls upon me to keep the peace between Archons and their armies. So yes, as my loyal subject, I do indeed require your help to resolve this situation.

If [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] does find me negligent in matters, rest assured that all of my Fatebinders will be rounded up and buried with me.

Next time you adopt this tone, there had best be answers and results along with it.

It is unclear from your tone if you are attempting to anger me or test my reaction. In either case, you are only half-successful.

I sense you may be a growing concern - I will ensure that [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] keeps a closer eye on you.

[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' rule is righteous and inevitable. To oppose the peace is to wantonly tolerate evil and criminality.

Those who reject [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' rule are beneath your contempt - to kill them is not murder, to steal from them is not theft.

While enemies deserve no quarter, all who accept [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' rule must be granted mercy and peace - provided their oath of fealty is sincere.

[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] does not wish to rule over dust and ashes - endeavor at all times to convince the rebels to disarm and join our side, violent disposal should be your last recourse.

The [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] does not give weight to words when spoken on behalf of others. They are impressed by direct action and immediate confrontation. If you wish to garner their favor, you must do so on your own. Nothing I could say would sway such a chaotic group to your side.
