It has come to my attention that you have access to another Spire. Now many have claimed a Spire with mere words, you are the first in recent memory to claim by deed. Rumors tell of a fantastic light show the moment you took the Mountain Spire... this connection of yours to the Spire is truly exceptional.

Should you desire to learn more of these monuments (and who would be foolish enough to say no to that?), it would behoove you to visit me in [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s Court. I will tell you what you need to do.

You've known me for how long now... a decade? Two? Remember that I told you I was a fond, patient man, full of second chances? Of course you don't, because I'm not a simpering idiot prone to saying such things.


I sent word earlier that we should speak... I will assume your tardy response is the side effect of duty, not negligence. But if you do not care to benefit from my wisdom, so be it - you're old enough to clean up your own messes.

If, however, you decide you would rather be successful in your current endeavors, come see me. There is much to discuss.

Did you build that library yet? I have a feeling you didn't, but please prove me wrong.

I have heard a library was built atop your Spire... a wise development - thank you for heeding my advice.

Find an excuse to travel to the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url] - we should speak further about arcane matters now that you are patron of the letters.

Should you require help in your research (as I am sure you do - if only since your work no doubt leaves you few idle hours for reading), seek me out. If you are willing to tolerate my presence in your sanctuary of learning, I could assist in your studies.

The greatest insult one can give to a teacher is to remain a student one's whole life. For once, you have truly failed to disappoint me - I have learned much from you in these recent times.

There is an immense joy - pride verging on mania - when I think of what you have accomplished. I wish that I could brag to the others that have some shred of the Overlord's talent... but such things will remain a secret. I feel I must caution you to not use your powers wantonly, but should you ever use your knowledge of the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Malediction, it will, at least, absolve me of the need to keep this amazing secret.

Remember what you are, what you've become, and where you started. And know that your power draw the ire of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] - the question is when, not if, you attract the Overlord's full attention.
