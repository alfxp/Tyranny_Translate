You are to report to [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] at once - no delays. Make haste to his court in the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url], there you will answer the Adjudicator's questions.

If you acted within the bounds of justice, you have little to fear, but [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] wishes to know the truth of what occurred at [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url] - and he wants to hear it straight from the mouth of his trusted agent.

If you acted outside of the bounds of justice... well, in that case, [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] and I get to come hunt you down. But we'll burn that bridge when we get to it...

-Calio

PS - I am most pleased that the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] didn't end your life. We spent so much time and effort training you, it seems a waste to see you die this young.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Acknowledged, looking forward to seeing your [scribbled out series of words] charming presence.

With the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] and [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] at odds, it will fall unto us, [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s deputies, to maintain order in this sweltering, forsaken land. May the honor of our cause give you strength.

      <DefaultText>While I am disheartened that my training has not inspired more confidence, it is wise to ask for help in trying times such as these.

There are some tasks that require my immediate attention, but if we Fatebinders do not foster each other's skills, who will?

We'll speak again on this matter when the time is right. It's been too long since I've given you disapproving glances when you miss your targets.

      <DefaultText>Calio,

Thank you for delivering the message, but instruction time is over, and I no longer require your oversight and lectures.

Tell [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] I'll be there when I'm ready. If he has an issue with that, have him send an envoy to the Mountain Spire and I will entertain his messenger.

      <DefaultText>Calio,

Request received, I will leave at once for the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url].

It seems my assignment in the Tiers has taken a turn for the more... interesting. You trained me well, but considering the circumstances, I would not object to a few more lessons... if you are willing.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Calio,

I will depart as soon as this parchment is sent your way. I stand by my actions at [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url] and will debrief [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] in short order.

Well look who's growing curly hairs down below! You'll forgive me, but [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] did not include me in the missive wherein you were promoted to Chief Justice of all Terratus.

You know what the best part of my job is? No, not the abuse of power - that was cute at first but the charm has worn off. No, the REAL joy is when I get to be the one that carves the rot that festers within the Court. Catching a criminal is easy - bringing a rogue Fatebinder to justice... that's a worthwhile hunt.

I've always sort of not entirely hated you entirely, [Player Name]. But the day you give me an excuse to destroy you, it's just a matter of whether it's me or [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] that gets to you first.

Now get your ass to Court.
