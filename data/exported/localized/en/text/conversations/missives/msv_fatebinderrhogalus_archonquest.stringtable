      <DefaultText>My dear [Player Name],

The Court is all abuzz with the news of the civil war. Representatives from the Chorus and the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] are having little shouting matches in front of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url], the petitioners to the Court seem swept up in talks of who will crush whom and if and when [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] will bring down the gavel and stop the fighting.

What has me more intrigued is the OTHER story out of [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url]... [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] sends you on what I thought was going to be a one-way trip to the Well and not only do you live... you somehow claimed the Mountain Spire. And you broke [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] too! Such things make a little civil war seem so trivial in comparison... at least to those who can separate the message from the noise.

Tell me, what was it like to break the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]? And how it is you took control of the Spire?

      <DefaultText>Dear Rhogalus,

It's usually quite difficult to give me too much credit, but it sure sounds like you're implying my claim on the Spire was premeditated or even intentional.

My only goal in [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url] was to stay alive - to not let the Archons' indecision cause the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Execution to come to pass. [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url] needed to be taken, and I made it happen - both because it was my duty, and because I generally prefer to live.

My claim on the Spire coincided with the breaking of said [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]. Perhaps breaking the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] caused a mystic surge that triggered the Spire... or perhaps [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] knew this would happen and such knowledge tempered the wording of the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] - I can offer you only these speculations.

      <DefaultText>Dear Rhogalus,

[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] simply said that an agent of the Overlord must claim [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url] before [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Day of Swords. The only thing I consciously did was take charge of the battle to claim [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url].

My 'claiming' of the Spire happened just moments after I felt the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]'s grip release. The floor of [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url] gave way, unearthing a glowing pattern buried beneath the chamber floor - [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] only knows how long it's been buried under the tile.

As for how I actually claimed the Spire - it is, perhaps, a mutual bond. Atop the Spire is an old structure, a twin-tined edifice - I'll include a sketch on the back of the parchment. This structure spoke to me in sensations and images - and it seems to respond to my presence in some limited capacity.

That is what happened, as best as I can think to describe it. Does any of this sound familiar or bring to mind any old stories or rumors?

      <DefaultText>Dear [Player Name],

Your summation is most fascinating, thank you for sharing.

You are certainly not the first to proclaim an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] - many of us have been used to complete the casting of the Overlord's magic. And you aren't the first to break and [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] - though that list of names is a smaller, more exclusive list.

What's curious though... living and recorded memory make no mention of someone who proclaimed and shattered the same [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]. In that regard, you are an anomaly.

The bad news is, the Archons know this and will be suspicious of this distinction.

Along with this parchment, I have included the contact information of the Honorable Fatebinder Myothis, an old peer of mine and perhaps the most knowledgeable in the Court on matters not taught to us by [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]. Treat her with respect, and she will not betray your confidence.

Best of luck, [Player Name], I think things are about to get even stranger for you.

My apologies, after all these years with my lectures about the fittest goat being the first to get eaten, how can I expect honesty when I have fostered only paranoia?

So let me speak plainly - I am asking only for my own curiosity... and because I want to hear the answers from you. Lie to me or dodge the question if it pleases you, but I'm trying to help.

Of course, someday soon, I'm sure [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] or [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] will ask me or Calio to mount a more proper investigation into your actions... should that happen, it won't be with your best interest at heart and lies will merely sign your death warrant.

For the moment, I'm merely curious about the events surrounding the claiming of the Spire, and hoping to hear it from you as a friend and peer. Share with me your experience, and I will share with you what knowledge I have.

      <DefaultText>Dear Rhogalus,

You seem to think I've learned nothing from my time in Court. Whatever I tell you will just be used against me later. You will have to settle for the written equivalent of a blank stare.

      <DefaultText>Dear Rhogalus,

Did you know what the wording of the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] would entail? Did you advocate that I be sent on what was likely to be a one-way journey?

Your questions seem to imply that my actions at [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url] were orchestrated when they were, in fact, the product of me responding to a chaotic situation - nothing more. Dealing with two petulant, disagreeable Archons occupied what precious time I might have spent undermining [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url].

How about you tell me what you know first? You were the one who taught me the value of never being tricked into self-incrimination - and how could I possibly argue with that sort of wisdom?

      <DefaultText>Dear [Player Name],

Your tone seems so cold, distant, and distrustful - it's almost like you've been paying attention all these years.

Yes, I knew I learned about the wording of the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url], and while I did not advocate that you be sent, I did not disagree. Like it or not, you are young, fit, and entirely self-sufficient - you should be flattered to be trusted for the honor of proclamation.

I'm asking about your experience because it's not every day that someone breaks an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] - let alone awaken a Spire... if I had some insight into your experience, perhaps I could shed light on what happened, or get you in touch with someone who could.

You insufferable upstart, how dare you take my sermons on cynicism to heart! I expect you stupid youngsters to ignore me, not to actually listen to my wisdom. You're threatening the whole social order of things!

Perhaps it's best you say little to me on these matters. Better you speak with the Honorable Fatebinder Myothis - though I suppose Binder Emeritus is a more apt title - as she's free of official duties and idles her days in an estate up North, far from the war, far from watchful eyes. I am one of the few to whom she will speak - with my blessing (and if you curtail your attitude) she might share what she knows with you.

On the reverse of this parchment, you'll find instructions to contact to Myothis - I encourage you to open up about the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] and your experience with the Spire. There is much you need to learn.
