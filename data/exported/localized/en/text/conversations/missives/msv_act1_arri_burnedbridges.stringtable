      <DefaultText>We are not completely without our senses - we knew [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] would issue an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] on our valley. Perhaps the Overlord has a sick sense of humor, but I can assure I laughed when I learned the death sentence doomed the oathbreaker and puppet equally.

I had such low expectations for the servant of the so-called Archon of Justice. [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] seems little more than a passive stooge that sits on a throne to legitimize the carnage and plunder of the other Archons - the Face of Prosperity that lets [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] claim one thing while being another. I would have hoped you actually did serve Justice - the notion, not the Archon... but your actions have said otherwise. At least I can thank you for proving my cynicism entirely warranted.

If you survive this upcoming slaughter, bear witness that I, Tarkis Arri of the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url], do take responsibility for the actions of my crew. Should my warriors come before the Court's axe, tell [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] they were starving, desperate, and easily manipulated into a struggle that was mine, and not theirs. Sell this lie as well as you would sell the lies of the Overlord.
