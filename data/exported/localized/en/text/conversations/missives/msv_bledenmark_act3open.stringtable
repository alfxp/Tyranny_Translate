      <DefaultText>Kid,

I take it you're aware of the Overlord's latest decree. If not, let me give it to you straight. Now's a bad time to be an Archon in the Tiers. Since most likely I'll be the one to cut you down, I thought I'd first explain - it's not my choice. 

But if it was, I would still choose to kill you. See you soon,

If I am to die by your hand, I would prefer it be in battle, face to face (or would that be face to shadow).

Regardless, at the risk of depriving you the thrill of a good ambush, I would ask that we meet in person, as peers - drawing blades openly - if it that is what it is to come to. On the reverse of this parchment, I've mapped for you a location in the wilderness. Let us meet and settle things there.

I'll provide you two days to scout the location in advance should you require.

Hope to see you there,

      <DefaultText>My Dearest Mark,

I must sincerely thank you for the forward warning. Please know that I have, indeed, taken your words to heart and, as such, return the following in reply - 

Certainly, I would not expect you to follow me without first testing my mettle. If we must slay each other, so be it. I respect your prowess and will stand my ground if a duel is what you desire, but I would ask that you consider instead pledging your blade to me, rather than aiming it for my throat. 

Does [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' decree insist that we kill each other, or merely that one should best the other? 

Warm regards,
- [Player Name]</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Mark,

I'm sorry who are you, again? Oh, right, that creepy guy who stares at people from the shadows. If you want to say hello, just come talk to me, already.

I should thank [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], as the Overlord has finally unburdened me of the need to treat you like anything more than what you are: a sad little sociopath who will soon be gasping for his last breath at the end of my weapon.

Did your predilection for children turn even the cast-metal stomach of the Chorus? I've often wondered what crime [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] must have on you to keep you on such short a leash. Of course, short leashes are ideal if the servant lives only to lick his master's feet.

Sharpen your blades, freak. I'm coming for you. (Because let's face it, you can't come for me before you're ordered to, can you?)

      <DefaultText>Kid,

Since it was you that asked, sure. Why not? I could wait for the Adjudicator's official order, but this seems much more interesting. 

Here're my conditions - we meet alone and we meet with our blades drawn. And no crying when I carve your eyes out.

I've already scouted the clearing you indicated in your note. Arrive when you like, and I'll make my presence known.

Remember - no tears. No begging.

If I haven't said it before, I'll say it now. I'm going to enjoy killing you. Can't wait for the execution order. I'll be anticipating your arrival at the Court.

      <DefaultText>[url=lore:Missive_BledenMark]Kid,

I have to say, you never did play by the rules. But now you've ceased even pretending to serve the Overlord, to which the Adjudicator is not amused. Unfortunately, the chaos you have wrought in casting an unsanctioned Edict hinders our campaign in the Tiers and weakens belief in the Overlord. You will at once, come to our Court, largely, to offer penance for threatening Kyros' rule of the Tiers. But do not fear,[/url] [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] [url=lore:Missive_BledenMark]will preside without bias, and order me to execute a sentence that is fair in the eyes of the law, and only if you are found guilty at the trial. But I can promise you this - If you want to live, it would be unwise to ignore his summons. If and when you first wish to speak with the other Archons to beg mercy, we will not prevent you but we would encourage you to refrain. At our behest, [/url][url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] [url=lore:Missive_BledenMark]and[/url] [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url][url=lore:Missive_BledenMark], are also weighing the consequence of your bald-faced rebellion.[/url]

If I haven't said it before, I'll say it now. I'm going to enjoy killing you. Can't wait for the execution order. We'll settle this now. Meet me in a spot of shade in depths of Ashweald. That is, if you're not afraid of being swallowed by the dark.

If I haven't said it before, I'll say it now. I'm going to enjoy killing you. And while I'd love to carve your heart out and feed it to the darkness in a remote spot in a shaded weald, unlike you, I'm not dumb enough to act on a whim. Can't wait for the Adjudicator's execution order. I'll be anticipating your arrival at the Court.
