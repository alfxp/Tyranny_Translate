I knew our respite from invasion would be short-lived... we are once again under attack. The [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] has sent a regiment of troops to [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url] - perhaps hoping the third time around we'll stay dead - and this time they brought a much larger cadre of conscripts.

Rally to the Mountain Spire at once. I will act as your marshal for the time being and rally your followers, but we need you here - both because your strength is essential for victory and because I'm afraid your coalition may fracture if they feel abandoned in this time of need.

Eagerly awaiting your homecoming,
