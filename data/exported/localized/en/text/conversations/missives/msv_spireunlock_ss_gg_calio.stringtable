      <DefaultText>Fatebinder,

Your partnership with the Tiersmen continues to incite controversy here, though some of us are optimistic about your endeavors. 

Your claim over the Spires has become a much-discussed phenomenon. I think you may be interested to know of another in the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url], at Gulfglow.

If such information bears fruit for you, please remember the contributions of your friends in the future.
