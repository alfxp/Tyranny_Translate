      <DefaultText>I did not get into the freedom fighting business to be loved or respected, so it was with some relief that you came around and offered a more obvious figurehead.

Pity the Tiers, for you've turned out to be our ruin, not our champion. The coalition we were just beginning to hammer into shape is now splintered and fragmented. Our cause is leaderless, and our enemy only emboldened by the defiance we once promised, but can no longer back with action.

Should we live to cross paths again, I hope it is because I see you strung up like any other victim of the Overlord's chaos.

Our coalition has already fallen into ruin - such is the nature of desperate causes. You were unable to secure additional help in [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url], and this has given many cause to question your leadership, and the worthiness of our plans.

A shame we did not accomplish more.</DefaultText>

We have tasted the sweet iron of the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url], only to have the smith-mages withdraw from our coalition. Without someone to rearm and repair, the soldiers have lost hope that things will improve. Despite my best efforts, I could not keep the warriors in line... our band has scattered.

Our Beastmen 'allies' have turned on us - I don't know what was said to enrage them, but blood was drawn and our coalition is shattered... my men are now being hunted by the Beasts we thought would work with us.

It seems our cause is a lost one. A shame we did not accomplish more.</DefaultText>

The [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] refuse to assist our coalition, and the lack of unity has caused a fatal rift in our band. Without Stalwart, many in the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url] insist we will never recruit a formidable army - such worries have become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

A shame we did not accomplish more... liberation of the Tiers almost seemed possible.</DefaultText>

I write to inform you that our coalition has fallen into ruin. It seems we will not have the help of the School of Ink and Quill, and this lack of support has demoralized the soldiers. Our warriors have all scattered, our ability to fight has ended.

A shame we did not accomplish more... liberation of the Tiers felt so close at hand.</DefaultText>

Our coalition has been shattered. I regret to you inform you that the Earthshakers have withdrawn any and all offer of help - and in doing so, have sent a no confidence message that rippled through our group. Our merry band has been scattered to the wind.

A shame we did not accomplish more.</DefaultText>
