      <DefaultText>Fatebinder [Player Name], if you are reading this, we have lost the river Matani. Surrounded and without escape, we will fight to the death, but the common refrain we hear is: "[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] wishes not to rule over a wasteland." Is there truth to this mantra, or is it another of the Overlord's lies?

We wish to meet under the truce of a blue flag, to discuss how serious the Overlord is in his mercy. See the reverse of this parchment for directions to a meeting site. Arrive with only a small entourage - asking you to come alone is hardly fair, but if reinforcements are shadowing you, we will know.
