      <DefaultText>"What's this now? A Fatebinder in [Plainsgate]? Tch."

The battle-scarred Fury looks you up and down, unimpressed. The he scratches the end of a dirty thumbnail along the pockmarked front of his throat in thought.

      <DefaultText>He scoffs and fingers the puckered scar bisecting his throat.

"You have no idea the prices I've paid in this short, wretched life. The world must seem a pretty place to one who licks the heels of an Archon. But the rest of us are drowning in the blood and excrement of the dead, trying to pretend it's river water flooding our chests."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hedgy, ain't you, boss?" He grunts. "Don't worry, our little scheme has potential for profit written all over it. You see that lumbering Beast they got chained there?" He juts his chin in gesture toward the crowd.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A group of townsfolk caught the Beast a ways outside the city, night before last. Don't know whether he's done it or not, but they're wailing he ate one of their own. Now they want nothing but to string him up or skin him alive."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Course, the idiot won't talk - does nothing but snaps and drools and growls. So it won't be long 'till they've killed him. Tch. What a waste of a warrior." 

Slowly, he runs a finger along the scar that mars the length of his throat. He peers intensely at you from behind the narrowed eye slits of his mask.

      <DefaultText>"So if you could convince the fine townsfolk of [Plainsgate] not to remove our feral friend's head from his shoulders, and hand him over to the Chorus instead, well, it'd be a huge help to the cause."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Good, 'cause you're no use to me dead." He utters a brusque laugh, but at the same time, he fingers the mottled scar on the front of his throat more vigorously. 

He jerks a thumb toward the raucous crowd behind him. "You see that lumbering Beast they got chained there?"</DefaultText>
