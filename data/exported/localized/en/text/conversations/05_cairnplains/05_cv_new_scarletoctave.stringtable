      <DefaultText>"I'll gladly take the help, boss. But even a Fatebinder might find this one difficult. The leader of the [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url], Hundred-Blood, is one tough mutt, and she doesn't like humans."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A grimy, dust-caked man cracks a somber smile at your approach. He wipes a hand across his mouth, leaving a smear of dry clay behind. "Well, well. What's a Fatebinder of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] want in Stone Down Gorge? You come to help us or fight us, boss?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Not much, other than that they're all up in a snit over us even being here.

He spits a wad of Vagrant's Chaw at your feet. Lazily, he dips into his side pocket for a fresh pinch of the dried leaves.

      <DefaultText>He nods his head toward the heavily fortified compound to the south. "The Earthshakers are holed up snugger than a fox family in winter. Me and the gang can't find a single path in. I'm thinking they've collapsed the stone bridges connecting the canyon."

He licks chapped, bloodless lips, eyes scanning the distance as he thinks. Finally, he sighs.

      <DefaultText>"Well, now that you mention it..." He clears his throat and ducks his head, hiding a shifty sort of grin behind his dirt-streaked fist.

"Suppose they might've seen an Earthshaker or two raising and lowering the ground in this one spot to bridge the chasm between us. It's guarded, of course, so I figure it's their entry gate."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ignoring your indignant glare, he continues almost to himself more than anything. "It's a neat little trick. Some earth spell that turns the terrain into a type of draw bridge for them." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Look, I know it's my job to help you kill [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url], boss. But say I'm a little too good at doing my duty. Say you want to promote me to the front lines or some difficult-to-survive task, and on account of that, I don't live to claim my plot of farmland at the end of all this. Would be a damn shame, don't you think?"

He tucks a wad of Vagrant's Chaw behind his bottom lip and shrugs, completely unrepentant. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yeah, and we ain't getting across that gap without a bridge of some sort. We've already tried."

He coughs lightly as he scratches one eyebrow.

"I can tell you it's far enough that it killed Deviant Thoran. Just not immediately on impact."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Whatever it is, I can tell you it won't be to revitalize this realm. The [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Stone is hurting the Chorus far worse than the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]."

He spits a gob of Vagrant's Chaw at the ground.

"Maybe they've found a way to heal [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] and ensure the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] never ends. Or maybe they've found a way to fuck us even worse than we already are."</DefaultText>
