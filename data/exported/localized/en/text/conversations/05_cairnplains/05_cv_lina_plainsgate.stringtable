      <DefaultText>"Kill the Beast! Fifty bronze rings to drape his pelt over my wagon!"

The rioting settler notices you and pauses. "You're the Fatebinder we heard was coming around, aren't you? Folk from [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s Court don't often make it to these parts." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That goes without saying. As long as there are Beastmen, they will be a problem. Case in point - this one killed a settler night before last." She gestures beyond the crowd. 

"If the savages are hunting our people, then we need to return the violence tenfold. I doubt the hairy, shit-stained freaks will respond to anything less than a massacre."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Even with the dust settled, the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] set their gaze on swelling the ranks. They're less aggressive about it these days, but sometimes you hear of their bloody conscription rites." 

"They break into a home, take what they want, and tell whoever lives there to pick up a blade and swear fealty to [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] for a chance at seeing the sunrise." She shakes her head.</DefaultText>

The Chorus also has some plan to break the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Stone, but I wish they'd do it without troubling the rest of us.

      <DefaultText>"It was my mother's idea to put some distance between us and Azure. She knew better than to run afoul of the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] on their march.

"You ask me, it's the fault of those mages. They were only interested in Azure when [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] split the earth apart. Whatever they found, it can only cause trouble."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'd guess that's half the reason Plainsgate didn't fare worse in the war. There were plenty of wealthier cities in Azure for the Chorus to sack. Sometimes the best defense is being the poorest pocket in the market."</DefaultText>
