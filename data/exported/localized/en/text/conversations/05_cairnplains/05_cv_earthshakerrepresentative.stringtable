Ashe would have seen us killed under [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Law, but [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] saved us.

She twirls the splintered haft of her own staff between her slender fingers, eying the energy that swirls within the bejeweled tip.

      <DefaultText>"And now we add [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]'s knowledge to our arsenal - magnificent." Eb lets out a long, purring sigh. "I hate to say this, but I feel like I understand [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] - well, a little, at least.

She sighs, shoulders weighted with regret. 

"To survive, those we've left behind will have no choice but to serve the Archon of War, more earnestly than ever. Should a time come when we are forced to face them on the battlefield, I can ask only that you be merciful to them at such a time."</DefaultText>
