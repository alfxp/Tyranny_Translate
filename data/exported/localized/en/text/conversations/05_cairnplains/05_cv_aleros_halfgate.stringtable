      <DefaultText>"Watch your step, Fatebinder. The [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url] is a rather steep drop from Halfgate's edge. Wouldn't want you to slip off, now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And by a Fatebinder like you no less. No offense to you, of course, your good Justice. But if I ever get my sights on who did this, I'll give him a ripe piece of my mind. This city lost everything to the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]. Her homes, her people - even her name. You can't imagine what it was like to watch her quake and burn."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Now that the city's death slide has settled, we only have to deal with the occasional rumbling - the tremors that come and go like sweeping summer storms. Most blame the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]. The Earthshakers are no help at all. The [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] at least want to solve the problem."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Afraid not. I'm plumb out of, well, everything. A bit of gabbing's all I've got to trade at the moment, if you're in the market."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You, Fatebinder?! It was you who destroyed our beautiful city? How could you? We lost everything to the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]. Our homes and neighbors - our whole lives. You can't imagine what it's like to watch your home quake and burn."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Have you come to help, then? Those meddling Earthshakers are protecting [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url], but for the life of me, I couldn't tell you why. Maybe they like the trembling he causes every time he rattles and moans. But how are we to rebuild so long as the Archon lives?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well, we don't like them, but we don't hate them neither. They've got a plan to stop the earth's trembling. So they say. Kill [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] - kill the quakes. Once the land's at rest, we can rebuild and farm again."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, we didn't like them, but we didn't hate them neither. They said they had a plan to stop the earth's trembling. Kill [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] - kill the quakes."

He sighs. "Guess we won't know now, will we?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Mouth quirked in contemplation, he scratches at his chin. "Well, it's not like they were the only few what infested the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url]. Say their army does find [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] - once the land's at rest, we could rebuild and farm again."</DefaultText>
