      <DefaultText>As the ground beneath your feet settles, finally, into a blissful calm, feelings of lightness and vitality begin to burble through your veins.

The [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Stone has ceased, and with the dissipation of its powerful draining force, the world feels once again alive with arcane energy and currents of magic. The sense of weightlessness in your body brings to mind the events of [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url] and the end of the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Execution. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Mm hmm. Certainly. Azure could use it more than anywhere. When life returns to this place, the Tiers will have an easier time of growing food and fending for themselves. More autonomy from the Northern Empire too, I warrant." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Interesting way of looking at it, but consider that you are still drawing breath. If you truly 'stole' from [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] that which [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] did not want taken... you'd be in [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]'s lot."</DefaultText>

      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Quite right. [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' will be done and all that, but no one could argue that it's time to heal." He glances down at his scribbling, and then back up at you. "I wonder if you always viewed yourself as a would-be savior, or if something about the conquest changed your mind?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"So it's power and influence you're after, and this is just the course you've chosen for now. Fascinating. It's certainly a contrast from the more straightforward approach of the early conquest. Instead of working within the chain of command, you're re-forging the links to suit your will."

Smiling, seemingly pleased with himself, he hurries to write that down.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"One last question for now. How do you feel - physically and mentally, I mean? I ask because there's very little precedent on the matter, and you could define the symptoms and reactions for... well, for history as a whole. An arcane feat on this scale doesn't happen every day."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Dizziness, eh?" Lantry taps his quill thoughtfully. "Could be due to the mental effort. Or something else..." Unconcerned, he shakes his head.  "You look fine to me. If you feel any different over time, I hope you'll let me know." </DefaultText>

      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Is that right? I'm glad to hear that breaking Edicts hasn't disintegrated your flesh and bones but has, instead, improved your constitution. But let's not put that sprinting without a sweat boast to the test just quite yet."</DefaultText>

      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Mmm." Lantry taps his quill on his wrist. "That's no small concern. If breaking these Edicts is impacting your sanity or willpower, I would question how far you want to pursue this goal." He pauses to regard you and grin. "Admittedly, such concerns never stopped me in the past. I would tell you stories about some of the things I've read... except that I've worked very hard to forget them."</DefaultText>

      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I see. In that case, I won't tax any more of your time. If you're feeling more talkative, you know where to find me." 

Without another word, Lantry licks his quill clean, wipes it across his sleeve, then tucks it into his sleeve.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I..." Lantry takes a step back. "I would prefer to take the account from a primary source, but in this case I think it safer to paraphrase and embellish. Does that sound..." He shakes his head. "On second thought, don't answer. The Chronicle will be better for it if you don't speak." He clears his throat and wipes the quill across his sleeve. "Thank you for your time, Fatebinder." </DefaultText>
