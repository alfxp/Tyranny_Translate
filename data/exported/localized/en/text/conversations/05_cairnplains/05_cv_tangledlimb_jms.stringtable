      <DefaultText>"The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] lurk and creep in the shadows of tall rocks. They think we don't see them. But we're going to grind them to dust. We'll cleanse the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] from these lands, our lands - we'll burn them with Scarlet blood before the morrow."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That's too bad. We could use a warrior of your skill. We're headed to [url=lore:JaggedMaw]Jagged Maw[/url] to crack a few skulls. Luckily for us, a group of [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] have holed up in the shrine. It's past due we properly welcome them - into a quick death."

He scratches a pustule on the lobe of one ear. "To be honest, I'm just excited to rip a few throats out."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Good on you, Fatebinder. Good on you! Well, as much as I enjoy conversing with you, I have to set off. My warparty's getting antsy. I'll be looking forward to spilling blood with you soon, Fatebinder."</DefaultText>
