      <DefaultText>"Beastman will believe human can be [url=glossary:stonestalker]Stonestalker[/url] when human proves such with survival." Blood-Rock grunts and snorts. He scratches at his side and thumps his foot, agitated. "Is not tribe's fault if frail human dies." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Beastman grins viciously before bowing his head to you. "To become [url=glossary:stonestalker]Stonestalker[/url], human only must win fights. As all [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url] endure rite in young season, fight is to prove strength and show skill, not for killing."

He glances to the three, brutish warriors at his side. "But some past fights [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url] become too vicious. Deaths happen if not careful, yes?"

The three warriors bob and laugh, a snarling and high-pitched sound bordering on hysteria. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"First fight has finished and human still lives. Beastman is surprised." Blood-Rock scratches at his snout, his arrogance slightly tempered. "But rite must continue."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Still alive? Annoying human." The Beastman growls, but holds himself in check, knowing better than to attack you. "Blood-Rock is impressed. Dark-Foot and Crimson-Stone were strong [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url]. Swift, savage fighters. But rite is not finished."

He nods to your next opponent, and he snarls, head bobbing repeatedly, up and down, in rhythm to a beat you cannot hear - the pulse of the tribe.

"Fighting must continue."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He sniffs at you as you pass. His tongue lolls, dripping saliva on the stone ground as he pants. "Human is [url=glossary:stonestalker]Stonestalker[/url]. Is first blunt-claw to protect tribe."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She snorts, unamused. "Can try. Only prey to die will be [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url]."

With a deadly grin, she assesses your opponents. "Stone whelps are weak whelps. Is true even for tribe's toughest warriors. Come, fight Shadowhunter and Alpha to Kills-in-Shadow.
