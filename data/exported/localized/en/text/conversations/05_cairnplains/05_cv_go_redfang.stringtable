      <DefaultText>The Beastwoman cocks her head to one side, listening intently. Her ear flicks once, twice, and her eyes narrow suspiciously.

"Who pads here? Soft-soft-slow? Who braves to approach Red-Fang, guard-eyes of [url=glossary:stonestalker]Stonestalker[/url]'s Oldwalls-den?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Human should kill Red-Fang first." She licks her discolored fangs and languidly rolls into an attack, a low-sweeping swipe of her claws. "Since Beastwoman will be death of human," she chuffs, confident in the promise of your imminent defeat.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Beastwoman curls her claws against the flat, hairy plain of her stomach, trembling all over with excitement. "Hurry, human. Do not wait to show might of [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url] to any who threaten tribe's freedom." She sighs and gazes toward the exit dreamily, perhaps considering joining you, however briefly. "Hurry and kill. And let Beastwoman lick blood from fingers when finished.

      <DefaultText>"No." The Beastwoman growls, but there's no anger to her expression, only a deep-running mark of distrust. "Cannot believe. Red-Fang has been greeted by too many lying humans in past days. Humans lie about Elder Teeth, lie about true intentions and strength."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She regards you warily then slowly creeps closer, snuffling her nose against the crook of your neck. A low, pleasured growl rumbles from the depths of her muscular chest. "Human's scent does not lie. Red-Fang will trust and obey [url=glossary:prima]Prima[/url]. Will allow earth-mystics to leave alive. But if earth-mystics return, Red-Fang cannot promise tribe will not slaughter trespassers."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She rears back, biting off a premature snarl. "Reckless whelp." She regards you seriously for a moment, finally deciding with a derisive snort. "Can try. Can die, whimpering in own blood-spill. [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url] are born, yes, but are also built from battle. Maybe human can all survive Rite of Savagery and Stone.

Prove strong or weak." The Beastwoman huffs contentedly and drops to all-fours in a mock bow. "Chosen fighters await human outside.
