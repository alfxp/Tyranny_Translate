      <DefaultText>"That's Commander Ironcore to you, baby brother. And you, as well, Fatebinder."

The elite [url=glossary:iron guard]Iron Guard[/url] casts a steely glance in your direction without offering you a salute. 

"Forgive me if I do not have time to entertain idle pleasantries. We're on a campaign of the highest importance. I am sure you understand."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So you do come with a purpose." 

The [url=glossary:iron guard]Iron Guard[/url] turns the crushing weight of his attention on you, one strengthened by both magic and the austerity of his resolve. After a moment, the severity of his scrutiny slowly crumbles, and he nods as if to an unspoken decision.

"I'd be a fool to turn down the aid of a Fatebinder, especially one so renowned. I will accept any assistance I can acquire in uniting with my Earthshakers at [url=lore:Howling_Rock]Howling Rock[/url] and defending the fort they have erected around [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]'s remains."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What the Commander is trying to say, is we're beholden to have you." Caedis grunts, shooting his brother a pointed look. 

"Getting to [url=lore:Howling_Rock]Howling Rock[/url]'s the easy part. Only it hasn't been that easy. We've been waylaid with Chorus forces and Beasts that'll rend you limb to limb sooner than you can blink. They're bloodthirsty sons of curs, mark my words."</DefaultText>

Deftly, he draws his sword, and crouching, carves a basic map into the silt-covered ground. 

"Fastest route's through [url=lore:StoneDown]Stone Down Gorge[/url] - course, the area's swarming with Chorus and Beasts, alike."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Caedis clears his throat with a sound that's half hacking, half deep guffaw. He slouches in lazy attention, a hand resting comfortably on the hilt of his broad sword.

"I humbly apologize for the both of us. But if you don't mind me asking, what's brought you to these parts, sir?" 

He tips his head to indicate the stone expanse behind him. "Sure, she looks pretty, but don't let those big peaks fool you. The land's a tangle of danger."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The esteemed [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] Quillborne lived briefly in Jagged Maw, and wrote extensively of the magical stones that line the area.

      <DefaultText>"I think 'elder teeth' is the tribal name for the magical stones most human scholars know as 'Azurelith.' Thus the etymology of Jagged Maw. There's an old Azure superstition that Beastmen of centuries past were as tall as the Oldwalls, and the Azurelith are their petrified teeth. If you believe that, I've got a Spire to sell you."</DefaultText>
