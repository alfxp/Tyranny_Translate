      <DefaultText>"What's plain as day is that the Chorus is made up of dumbshits. You think your numbers are anything but decent odds for a squad of the best damn [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] this side of Stalwart?"

Noticing your approach, the lieutenant stiffens. "A Fatebinder... here? Is this how you planned to beat us, Tangled Limb?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] officer barks a laugh and relaxes his stance, unspoken tension draining from his shoulders.

      <DefaultText>The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] officer shakes his head in disbelief. He squares his shoulders so hard it trembles the sword clenched in his hands. "Damn me and [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' shit luck. I'll gut Radix if this mission doesn't kill me first." 

He lifts and readies his sword, crouching into a battle-stance as he shouts to his squad from over his shoulder. "You heard them, Shields! Nothing to do but buck up, hunker down, and cut their fucking heads off. Fatebinder or not, we've got a name to uphold and a mission to finish."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Armed to the teeth, the Chorus gangster sucks in a sharp breath. 

"What a beautiful, blood-tingling spin of events. Glad you could join us, Fatebinder!" 

He waves to you, a manic grin twisting his features into something ugly - a promise of pain and darker things. "Save me the officer. I'm going to cut his arms off for my collection."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The officer pales visibly but stands his ground. He doesn't move, doesn't even tremble, his whole body rigid as stone and seemingly riveted to the spot. For a moment you're not even sure he's breathing.  

But then his voice rings loudly, forcefully bold as he entreats you to reconsider. 

"Fatebinder! Are these the sort of shitbags you like to align yourself with? There's still time to pick the right side. Stay out of it - or, shit, join us - and we won't gut your entrails!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He tips his staff at you, seething and only a hair's breadth from violence. 

"The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]'s greed for [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]'s power has made them a continued pox on this land. The Chorus merely seeks to aid the struggling settlers of [Plainsgate] by ridding them of this black stain. Aid us and together we can end the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]'s foul deeds."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Chorus gangster observes the exchange, his jaw clenched in anger and a grim, dawning unease. He has no wish to face a Fatebinder in the fray but also cannot halt the coming, deadly clash that he, himself, has set into motion. There is no backing down and no hope for retreat.

There is only one avenue open to him, one final option he can try - to sway you to his side.

"Meddle in this affair," he grits, "and it'll be your end, Fatebinder. Our business has no need of an arbiter - we'll settle this dispute with blades and blood. However, if you must interfere, then I also must formally request your unbiased judgment before you twist the fates of this day."</DefaultText>

Caedis lifts his swords, ready to defend himself if necessary. The weight of your potential attack hangs heavy in the air, pressing a stiffness into his back and shoulders.

"Were it not my neck on the line, I'd surely find your jest amusing. But as such I must treat you as a foe, Fatebinder."

      <DefaultText>"The esteemed [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] Quillborne lived briefly in Jagged Maw, and wrote extensively of the magical stones that line the area. The way tribes describe it, those magic stones were here before landfall at the Five Wives.

      <DefaultText>"I think 'elder teeth' is the tribal name for the magical stones most human scholars know as 'Azurelith.' Thus the etymology of Jagged Maw. There's an old Azure superstition that Beastmen of centuries past were as tall as the Oldwalls, and the Azurelith are their petrified teeth. If you believe that, I've got a Spire to sell you."</DefaultText>

A bellow catches in his throat, and he falls, knees hitting the gritty, red-soaked ground first. With a shaking hand, he reaches for the sword in his belly - his sword, the sword that you're already pulling free - and he cries, or tries to, and you swing, and with only the slightest snag of blade on bone, slice his head clean free.</DefaultText>
