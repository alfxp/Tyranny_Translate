      <DefaultText>As you approach, you take a good look at the area where the townspeople have chained a Beastman, brutally and on display like some kind of public attraction. 

He watches his tormentors, visibly exhausted and wary, battered and bloodied and stinking of urine and old meat. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Beastman snarls and snaps at you, drooling tiredly as he strains against his bonds. His eyes are wide with fear, but his limbs droop tiredly and his whole body trembles. 

"Back away or lose both life and limb. Left-Claw still has killing-teeth. Can still maim, human!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Humans claim Beastman killed settlers, but Beastman has only hunted brown boar. [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url] don't eat meat from humans. Tell settlers."

He growls, angry and afraid.

"Left-Claw is good hunter. Tracked boar for tribe, but got bit by iron maw near ridge to human-den. Bled and bled - thought would have to rip through leg. Then sun woke and humans came, howling threats."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Humans are only cruel predators. Are only hunters that like hurting prey again and again before killing strike." He bares his teeth at you, but helpless to defend himself, it's an empty threat. "All animals die. Left-Claw is not afraid to join ancestors' earth-blood. But Beastman hopes human's own death will come from [url=glossary:stonestalker]Stonestalker[/url] ripping head from neck and heart from chest."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes, yes. Left-Claw will join Chorus pack to live." He whimpers and quivers at the prospect of his coming freedom, and for a moment he turns a violent, bloodthirsty gaze toward the townsfolk of [Plainsgate]. But then it's gone, and he's once more panting, harmless, eyes darting in search of his new allies - the gang that will protect him and in turn he will win wars for.

      <DefaultText>The air is heavy, silent, as the creature waits without moving, watching you for signs of hidden treachery. Reluctantly, he speaks. "Search for tribe-den in Stone Down." He swallows hard. "Free Left-Claw now. Will show human right path, will speak for human to Hundred-Blood. But if-if cannot, tell Hundred-Blood how Beastman has been hunted.

      <DefaultText>The Beastman bares his teeth at you, but helpless to defend himself, it's an empty threat. "Humans are only cruel predators. Are only hunters that like hurting prey again and again before killing strike. All animals die. Left-Claw is not afraid to join ancestors' earth-blood."

He spits in your face. 

"But Beastman hopes to first watch Kills-in-Shadow rip human's head from neck and heart from chest."</DefaultText>
