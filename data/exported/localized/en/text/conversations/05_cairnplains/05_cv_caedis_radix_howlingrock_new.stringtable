      <DefaultText>"Well-rested, huh?" Caedis jerks a glance at Radix. "Hate to think of what it might mean if that earlier show wasn't a Fatebinder at peak performance."

The lieutenant gives you a nod. "Glad you're with us, sir."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"While I served Ashe at [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url], in my stead, the guild succeeded in their mission to locate and guard [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]'s remains. Of course, none of us expected he would have survived."

He nods once in admiration of his former Master.

"My Earthshakers commenced studying [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] and, as a result, have unearthed a rather invaluable finding."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"[url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] yet labors to survive. This, of course, is ultimately infeasible. Even the mountains cannot withstand the force of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' will." 

"However, our Archon has retained a considerable sum of arcane energy. Energy that my guild could harvest - and wield." </DefaultText>

      <ID>8</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Your assumption is correct. However, my Earthshakers have devised a ritual wherein we can extract and expel [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]'s energy in one concentrated pulse upon his death. It would permanently ravage the land, starving Nerat's Chorus and the rebel army - enabling us to end the war."

The [url=glossary:iron guard]Iron Guard[/url] salutes you, steadfast in his devotion.

"While I would relish the opportunity to study [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] further, we cannot risk this strategic advantage. We must gain Ashe's approval to act, swiftly."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The [url=glossary:iron guard]Iron Guard[/url] stares at the both of you without moving, utterly austere and unamused. 

"Baby brother does not understand the notion of patience. A mountain cannot be moved by force - though try as he might." He sighs and clasps his hands behind his back. "But yes, I too would know of our plans."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Their primitive attunement to the terrene-arcanum of this region is pitiable. They should be begging us to teach them of our ways. Yet, instead they seek to lay claim to our Archon and scrabble to prevent us from utilizing the abundant Azurelith of this realm."

He stomps on the ground hard enough that a crevice splits between him and Caedis, causing the lieutenant to cautiously ease back.

"One day, I will crush the savages beneath the very stones they worship."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The lieutenant guffaws loudly. "If only. Radix might be the only man north of Stalwart that's more pigheaded than even me."

      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder." Radix spits a chunk of blood and tissue onto the ground as he one-handedly clutches the gash in his side. "You motherless, putrile, abject prick."

The [url=glossary:iron guard]Iron Guard[/url] settles his stance, peering silently toward the horizon for a moment before he continues to speak.

"Tortalus is the longest continental mountain range in the Northern Empire. Naturally, it was upon its highest peak that [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] established the Earthshaker guild and where I painstakingly acuminated the potential of my abilities." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Caedis, wait."  Radix raises a hand to stay his brother. The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] lieutenant stills, and the Master of the Earthshakers takes a moment to compose himself. He seems to be struggling with an unfamiliar and perhaps surprising surge of emotion. 

"If this is to be the end for us, baby brother, then forgive me, but I must ask you to stay. Even if you can spare but a few nights longer, please... delay your departure. There is much I would say to you first, and though I am loathe to admit it, my guild could use your aid."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Of course we can trust him." With an infuriated shake of his head, Radix turns his attention to the guarded soldier.

"Do not go yet. Even if you can spare but a few nights longer, you must delay your departure." He pauses, struggling seemingly with an unfamiliar and unbidden surge of emotion. "If this is to be the end for us, baby brother, there is much I would say to you in parting. And as well, I need you. My guild needs you. Please - aid me this one last time. Lend me your arms, only until after the ritual."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Caedis again shakes his head before this time tilting his masked face toward the sky, nearly beside himself. 

"You ask too much of me, Radix. But you know I can't deny you." An exasperated sound escapes the back of his throat. "l can stay only through the ritual. I'll aid you even - but I swear to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], if one word of this reaches the General, I'll be stripped of my rank, my armor, and likely flayed alive. Then you can watch mother cry."

He cants his head in a sidelong glance toward the rest of the encampment, clearly strategizing. "My Shields can't know what we're doing, understand? I'll figure out how to deal with them... later."</DefaultText>

"Sure, we could leave him to suffer for the next hundred years, but guarding [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] to keep the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] alive won't be so easy. It'll take resources and manpower to mount a suitable defense. And if we fail to stop an attack, we risk losing not only this post but the whole damn realm to the screamers - for good."

He turns to Radix. "It's not a risk I'd care to take. Would you?" </DefaultText>
