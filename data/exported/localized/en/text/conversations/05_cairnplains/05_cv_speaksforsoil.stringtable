      <DefaultText>As you approach, a hunched, elderly Beastwoman digs furtively at the ground. She startles at the sound of your footfall and rears up, clutching a gleaming shard of Azurelith to her chest.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The elder mystic bobs excitedly at your approach.

"Human smells of power and earth, blood and Bane. Has survived Rite of Culling. Has grown stronger for [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url]. Come, boast of best killing - was blow with mystic-claws or mystic-teeth? Sing softly to Speaks-for-Soil."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She presses a crystal shard to her lips and whispers softly, over and over. And over again. The sound is rhythmic and lulling, a repeated phrase unfamiliar to your ears.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She sniffs delicately in the air. Her crystals jingle as her head weaves side to side. "Human is both northern kith and [url=glossary:stonestalker]Stonestalker[/url]. How strange. How rare."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Mm, yes. Is [url=glossary:stonestalker]Stonestalker[/url] human. Stone-lands sing to Beastwoman. Have told mystic of human's great deeds for tribe." She tips an ear to the air, listening to whispers only she can hear - the sound of the wind rustling pebbles on the ground or the soft gurgle of a mountain creek.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Have survived Rite of Savagery and Stone to prove human has strength of Beastman. But human is not only tough, is mystic too. Needs also to sharpen earth-blood fangs and earth-blood claws. Must train in ancient ways of Stone-mystics - in Rite of Culling."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She presses a strand of purple Azurelith shards into your palm. The slivers of crystal warm to the touch, pulsing with arcane energy like a fluttering heartbeat. 

"Take Elder Teeth to crumbling Oldwalls behind Barren-paths of Gulfglow. Inspirit shards in Rite of Culling in order to forge own Elder Teeth necklace. Wear necklace and learn to swipe with mystic-claws."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Bane trap is best for training prowess of [url=glossary:stonestalker]Stonestalker[/url] mystics. Learn to toughen skin. Sharpen claws. Survive or die. Inspirit Elder Teeth for strength. Or return body to Stone-lands and mix with blood of ancestors. Either is good for tribe." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She weaves and bobs, voice a mere murmur. "Need lifeblood for rebirth of Stone-lands... for bloom... coming... when season of men must end..."

She drops to all fours, naked breasts scraping the stone ground as she lilts side to side. She presses her ear to the earth and closes her eyes. 

Her wrinkled fingers snake around an Azurelith shard, a tiny bud in a larger cluster, and she snaps it loose into her hand.

"...bone-scrape, break, dig..."</DefaultText>
