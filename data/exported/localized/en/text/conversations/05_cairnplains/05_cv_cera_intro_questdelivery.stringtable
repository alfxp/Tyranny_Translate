      <DefaultText>"A group of [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] entrenched themselves at Howling Rock not so long ago. Damn Earthshakers won't leave no matter what we've tried." She sniffs primly, indignant at the remembrance. 

"Whatever they're doing to that rumbling Archon, it's making the earthquakes worse. We'd be happy to be rid of them if only to calm the land."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Everyone knows there're Earthshakers camped at Howling Rock. Whatever they're tinkering with there, the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] want to stop it.

      <DefaultText>"Stopping the quakes would be a blessing, that's for sure. Don't guess you've any thoughts on how to do that, do you? The [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] say they've got a plan, but I don't trust much in their intellect - collective or otherwise."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You bet your britches, I would. That Beast's as guilty as they come. Look it, his fur's still matted in the blood of his victims, the settlers what went missing two weeks ago, no doubt. He reeks of it - the lives he stole."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Some folks believe we ought to consider his side, but there ain't no point to it, mister. Even if he ain't the one that did it, those Beasts are a threat to our survival. I'd knot the noose myself were the time come."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You think they fell or starved? No, the proof don't lie. They got ripped apart by a Beastman. Didn't they? I mean, that is, you don't really think he's innocent - do you, good mister?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She shrinks back, alarmed by the thought. "I'm no fighter, good mister. If anyone's going to die in [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' name, it ought to be a warrior, like a Beastman, right? I'd be no good at all, out there on the battlefield."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh look at that. Suddenly the beast has potential - a proper skein as a warrior! Insufferable bigots... sometimes I think [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] did us all a favor turning Azure into a memory. And it's a shame some of the rotten vines still endure. "</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I doubt this woman knows the first thing about arcane theory... but she's probably not wholly wrong in her speculation. The Overlord's magical [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] is the true source of the tremors - no simple mage could shake the land on this scale - but no doubt the Earthshakers are playing some dangerous game with magic well beyond their ken."</DefaultText>

Catching herself, she coughs uncomfortably before dabbing at the corner of her mouth with a tattered rag. "Now, I didn't mean nothing by that, Master Fatebinder. Even if you hadn't come along, I wouldn't trust much in a Chorus' promise. Sure, they've others out there in the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url], but who knows what they're capable of, if anything."</DefaultText>
