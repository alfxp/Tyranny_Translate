      <DefaultText>"[Player Name]." The Fatebinder of War tips his head to you. He bears a wide, boyish grin. It's a strange image, framed by the scruff of his beard and contrasted by the harshness of his years. "Thought the scamp I've been hearing about might've been you. No matter where you moor, you churn up a wake, do you not, my friend?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And you, as well." He rests a hand on the haft of his halberd, but it's merely a habitual, relaxed gesture. He rubs at his beard thoughtfully, posture utterly at ease. "Now, what's this about you withholding arcane knowledge from the Blood Chanters?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Fatebinder laughs, deep from the pit of his bowels. "Perhaps it is, but I found myself growing blunted, cooped up in the Courts. A good sword is wasted if not used, and so I decided to take a jaunt." 

He gives you a knowing look. "Better me than Calio, friend."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Fatebinder of War tips his head to you in brusque greeting. He regards you with a harshness, his face rough and jagged as stone. "Fatebinder [Player Name], I'm here following a flood of formal requests to adjudicate in your trial."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"When it concerns you - not in the slightest. Or were you unaware that [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] has grown wary of your recent... inclinations? You see, to win a war one must equally understand the minds of both their enemies and their allies.

He cuts at you with a discerning stare. "Better a calling from me than Calio, wouldn't you say?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Recently, the Fatebinder colluded with the Earthshakers to purposefully inspirit them with the remainder of [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]'s essence. Considering [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]'s apostasy against [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] and the Earthshakers' questionable loyalties, this act must be considered rash and shortsighted at best. At worst, we Blood Chanters would suggest it may even stem from treasonous motivations."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A Fatebinder has reportedly been aiding Sages throughout the Tiers, and I believe it to be [Player Name] as he has been sighted traveling with a [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] on at least one occasion.

Why would a Fatebinder of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] aid an unsanctioned sect over [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' own condoned mages within the Chorus?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Be that as it may, you have acquired a reputation for being particularly... pliant in your duties as a Fatebinder. Perhaps if you were to mentor an ardent band of front-line mages, it would adjust your perspective of the battle we fight. Yes, let it be so in the honorable name of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]."

He waves a hand as if relaying the order to a messenger on the battlefield, an old habit and one he's likely unaware of. 

"In addition, I will heft a fine of 200 rings. Let this caution you from the path you seek to stray, Fatebinder."

He tips his head to you in gruff farewell. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I fathomed as much, but it provided for an entertaining excursion - one I will regale for seasons to come."

He settles you with a boyish smile before turning a more severe expression on the Blood Chanter.

      <DefaultText>The Fatebinder nods, having no dispute with your supposition.

"[Player Name] speaks true. The authority of a Fatebinder grants us answer to [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] and [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] alone. Those who seek to impede our duties will suffer the wrath of the Court firsthand."

He steps closer to Ignatia, heavy armor shifting on his frame.

"Have you any proof of actual wrongdoing, Blood Chanter, or have you summoned [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s Fatebinder of War for no reason?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Fatebinder watches you warily as you approach, but it is only in the final breadth of distance that you realize his gaze is following not you, but the blood- and mud-caked Beastwoman at your heels. 

The hardened warrior's stance is stiff but ready. His hand rests on the iron hilt of his halberd, but he does not lift the weapon from its holster. 

"Is there nowhere you will not traipse, creature of darkness?" he demands. "Is there is no hovel in any Realm that you Beasts fear?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Did not come hunting for Fatebinder." The Beastwoman chuffs and tosses Nunoval a deadly grin. Her crimson eyes are bright with recognition, delight - and desire - as they rove the Fatebinder of War, slowly, from helm to boot. 

"But Beastwoman can see Fatebinder called Nunoval has remembered Kills-in-Shadow's vengeance. Yep-yep."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He bristles, and for a moment you worry he may actually attack. 

"As if I could forget." He taps his chest plate with two meaty fingers, hard enough that it nearly dents. "I am not the same as I once was. Try to carve me another memento, Beast, and I'll wear your pelt about my loins."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The massive Beastwoman cocks her head to one side, studying her prey. "Beastwoman, too, has grown and changed. Lost tribe. Lost Haven-lands. Follows Alpha who is human," she sniffs in disdain, "who is male - to survive."

She sits back on her haunches and huffs, allowing the tension between them to ease.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She bobs, momentarily excited, before settling down. Her rough, mauve tongue dangles, dripping saliva between her fangs as she chortles and yips deeply. 

"Shadowhunter, too, wants to hear. Tell humans what happened," she teases the Fatebinder of War.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's a story I do not care to tell, now or ever," Nunoval retorts. He flicks his gaze from the Beastwoman to you, clearly struggling to reign in his anger. 

"But a shorter explanation that may sate you is this - once, I lacked a healthy... appreciation for the Beast tribes of Haven. Your monstrous friend here took someone very dear to me, to correct my indiscretion."

He grunts, his red beard a trembling flame. "And that is all I will speak on the matter."</DefaultText>

He waves a hand as if relaying the order to a messenger on the battlefield, an old habit and one he's likely unaware of.

      <DefaultText>The Fatebinder of War watches, silent, without so much as a shrug or a sigh, and for a man of both his stature and sheer size, you wonder why he allows the Chanter's rampage.

      <DefaultText>Though Nunoval is eager to entertain your company, Ignatia lingers like an infected boil at your side. She demands, brashly, that you immediately begin her training. She is willing to follow you to the ends of the realms if need be, and she claims to know a spell to torment your dreams. And so, it is after waving the Fatebinder of War ahead with a promise to join him later, that you offer the Blood Chanter a stern but resigned nod. You attack arcanely and without warning, again and again, insisting she learn primarily through observation in combat. You correct her mistakes and spend the next several hours doing your best to utterly run her ragged, pleased to find that she is a proficient study.

Her face flushed with pride and exuberance, her shoulders slumped in exhaustion, she finally offers you her gratitude before limping off. You head off in search of your friend from the Court or for a soft cot near a warm fire, whichever you manage to stumble upon first. </DefaultText>

"I should've known no Fatebinder would be impartial in dealing with another!" She shrieks. "What a farce of justice! Knaves! You're blacker than [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url]'s shadows!"

Guards enclose and then escort her, still screaming - now obscenities - dragging her away until her voice diminishes into but a distant howl. </DefaultText>
