      <DefaultText>"I won't claim to like the idea of a Fatebinder who openly supports the agenda of a wholly deplorable group such as the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] - but desperate times necessitate desperate measures. I can scarcely return to Howling Rock empty handed without incurring the wrath of our [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] overseers."

He clears his throat, apparently bolstering what little sense of courage he holds. 

"Cause us no trouble - or better yet aid us - and I pledge I will do the same for you, Fatebinder."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What's in it for - !? Ah, of course." 

He glances to the side, clearly debating his options. As he scratches thoughtfully under his chin, his eyes slowly trail up to the luminous shard of Azurelith fitted  to the top of his staff. It is a spectacular specimen.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm loathe to part from it, but surely there are other specimens of a similar quality to be found... if only we were able to continue our excavation efforts..."

With a deep sigh, he nods once, decided. "I'll trade you my shard of Azurelith. It's exceedingly rare and of the utmost quality. Quite pure indeed. However you choose to utilize it, of course, is of your own concern."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He falls silent, awkwardly looking as if he expects, or rather, now hopes for you to leave. He fidgets with his focal staff, digging the haft into the ground. His cheeks flush, and finally he sighs audibly.

"Oh, all right. I did promise it to you. Here, take the blasted shard - lot of good it'll do a non-earth mage like you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He cocks his head to the side, thoughtful. "While I appreciate the kind assessment, Fatebinder, I'm not sure I'd deem our haul to be much more than scarcely adequate due to the duressed nature of our excavation. In fact, it couldn't hurt to harvest a few extras to supplement the collection. Perhaps some with more prominent striational patterns?"</DefaultText>
