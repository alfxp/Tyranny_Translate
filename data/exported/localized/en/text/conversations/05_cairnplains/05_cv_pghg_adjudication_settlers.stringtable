      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder, I request your formal adjudication in these proceeds. Surely, I'll lose my life if you don't intercede." The dirty refugee kneels, head bowed and greasy hair flung forward as he begs.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She shrugs as she wipes the flat of her blade clean. She sheathes it with an easy, gliding swing and kicks back on her heels. "I tried to spare you."

It's not entirely clear if her warning is meant for you or the still kneeling refugee.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The man doesn't wait to find out. His words tumble out rapidly, spurred by both his eagerness and fear now that he's garnered the full weight of your attention. 

"It's true we're displaced Tiersmen. We'd managed some semblance of survival, living in Azure's ruins after the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]." 

He clenches his fists in the folds of his tattered robes, the discolored remnants of Azure silk, to hide his shaking fingers. "This gentlewoman and her compatriots in the Chorus found us, but we did not resist. We surrendered forthwith and pledged ourselves - to [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Don't let them swindle you. The weaselly pricks just want us to ship them along. They know we don't have the manpower nor the resources to send them up the supply routes to [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url], so they're hoping to slip off." 

She widens her stance and tips her chin boldly, standing behind her decision. 

"If they won't pledge themselves to the Voices, we've no use for them."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Then do not dash this final hope." The noble bows his head. His fingers tremble as he sweeps his dirty, tangled hair the side to bare his neck. "Be merciful, I beg you - make it quick."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Whatever you say, Fatebinder."

The guard shrugs and scuffs the heel of her boot against the gritted, rocky terrain. It's clear she's irked, but she cannot dispute a claim for the interest of her own Archon. And, regardless, the end result will be the same. She may no longer be entitled to the bodies, but they'll belong to the Chorus either way. 

"But I could've had fun with this one. He's all soft and smooth and just asking to be broken."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I will, Fatebinder. I promise it on my name." He nods to you as he stands, dusting the grit from his knees, and his attendants rush to him. The three conspire of their future plans in low voices as you turn away.</DefaultText>

      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Indeed, I am." He licks his dried lips and glances off to the side, considering. He chooses his next words cautiously. "My attendants and I can be of service to the Courts. My intellect would not be wasted. I can bring you a wealth of knowledge regarding Azure's history and customs. Her magic and laws. Her royal line..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>For a moment the young man says nothing. His attendants protest in harried, hushed voices, but again he waves them off. 

"Wondering if I've this?" he asks finally as he dips two fingers behind the collar of his robe and reveals a glimpse of a gnarled, scarred insignia beneath his clavicle. [url=lore:Insignia_Azure_Royal]It's the mark of an Azure royal.[/url]</DefaultText>

      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>The young man lifts his face in a defiant glare. He's indeed filthy and stinking, his lips dry and cracked, his skin blistered and mud-streaked and peeling. But his frame is slight, his posture rigid, and his hands are remarkably smooth - uncalloused. 

"I will not hold my peace. We have rights - under [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' peace."

The woman rears the blunt edge of her sword for strike. Two burly, equally dirty refugees rush forward to defend the slighter man, but he stays them with a single raised hand, instead taking the blow harshly across his face.

His head whips to the side and he grimaces, spitting blood before he speaks again. "Fatebinder, please."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Assuming he got that brand legitimately," Lantry leans in with a whisper, "that marks him as a bonded retainer of Azure royalty. Safe to assume he's literate, educated, and was probably pretty wealthy up until a few years back."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She scowls, irked at being shut out. But she's quick to dismiss it, kicking back once more on her heels. "Tch, fine. Keep your secrets. Who could fathom what goes on in the head of a Fatebinder anyhow?</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The guard cocks her head to one side, studying the scrawny refugee before her. Slowly, she unsheathes her sword. "A regent-blood managed to cling on this long?"

Annoyed, she toes one of the soles his bare feet, making him flinch. "I could've had fun with this one. He's all soft and smooth and just asking to be broken. Maybe I'll just keep him for a bit."

But then she swings down the edge of her sword, smoothly cleaving his head from his neck.</DefaultText>
