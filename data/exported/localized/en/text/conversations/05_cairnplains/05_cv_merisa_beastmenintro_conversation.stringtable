      <DefaultText>"A group of our boys with some help from the Chorus caught the Beast just outside of town. They found him like that, fur all matted with blood and gore from hunting down humans! Just look at his snout, still stained with his wretched dinner."

The woman shudders and touches a grubby handkerchief to her mouth. She blots at her upper lip, pale-faced and swearing to the Archons.

"I wish he'd choked on it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Never thought I'd be happy to have the Chorus around, but for once they've done us right. Now all that's left is to see the brute killed." She sniffs and gives a curt nod. "But the Chorus are dragging their feet on the execution. If they won't avenge us, we'll have to do it ourselves."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Good. But the punishment should fit the crime. Why a hanging? If he ate a human, you should skin him alive."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You soft on Beastmen or something, Fatebinder? You'd rather side with them than humans? That killer was found with blood all over his face and paws right outside the gates! Who else you think he ate if it weren't one of us?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>11</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I hadn't thought of it that way, Fatebinder. You're right. A quick death's too good for what he's done. We ought to make him hurt and suffer - make him bleed."</DefaultText>

      <ID>12</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That monster killed and ate a human. And you call yourself a steward of justice?! Well go on then, deliver that Beast a well-deserved death."</DefaultText>

      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That so, Fatebinder? Why don't you go ask some of the others around then - see how many of us are interested in your thoughts on justice." 

She glowers, hands bunching the fabric of her dress as she adds, "He don't deserve to walk free, and you know it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There're some who want to hold a public trial first. Not me. I don't need the entertainment." 

She glares at the captive Beastman, hatred twisting her thin lips into a sneer. 

"I just want to see him punished for what's he's done."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You can't let that happen, Fatebinder! A smart man like you knows as well as I do, he ain't innocent! Won't you do something? That Beast needs to be punished!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She turns hard, stone-brown eyes on you. "And why aren't you? Don't you care about your own kind?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>The woman pales and takes an unconscious step back. "W-what will you do, Fatebinder? Do you mean to find him innocent?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>

      <DefaultText>"Wretched? I'm told man tastes a bit gamey, but wretched seems like needless hyperbole. It's not that far off from elk or loris... from what I'm told. In fact, I've read that the Kvatna tribe called human 'slow loris' on account of its taste... and ease of capture."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I wonder if [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] would agree with you. Since you are on better terms with the Adjudicator than I am, I suppose this is the most I'm to expect from [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' justice."</DefaultText>

      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I suppose it's good to hear that [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s agent hasn't forsaken us entirely, then. In these dark times, it seems like we're only growing more reliant on the forces of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] for our survival."</DefaultText>
