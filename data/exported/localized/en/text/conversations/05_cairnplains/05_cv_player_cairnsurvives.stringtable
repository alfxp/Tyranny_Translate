      <DefaultText>With the dust finally settled - or as settled as it will ever be in the endlessly shifting [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url] - you approach the enshrined Archon [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] and take a long, discerning look at him.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Maybe pack should trap Archon of Shadows in same way. See if mystic called [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] can make Shadowhunter as strong as [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] makes stone Beastwomen. Yep?"

She huffs and squats are on her haunches. 

"Alpha has been good to [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url]. Has helped survival of all Beastwomen. Kills-in-Shadow is maybe feeling jealous. But also is pleased."

When she looks up at you, it's with a dangerous grin.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Nearly petrified both inside and out, yet breathing; utterly encased in a mountain of rock, and groaning under the strain; unable to overcome the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Stone, but refusing to die - [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url], the one called the Betrayer, who was born a wild mystic of the northern peaks, will not be going anywhere for a long, long time or most likely ever again.

This is the price he must pay for defying the Overlord - and losing. But he need not suffer his fate in vain.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He bellows and moans in prolonged agony. His is going to be a gradual and torturous demise, spanning the next several decades - or even centuries - to come.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A barely perceptible tremor wracks his body from shoulder to spine. His back rises and falls in rhythmic, shuddering breaths, though his entire form appears carved of solid stone. You test the weight of his hand, but it is too heavy to lift, even for one of your strength. 

When you touch the pads of your fingers to his craggy skin, you can feel the acrid pulse and pull of his arcane energies slowly seeping into the land.

So long as [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] remains entrapped in the Realm of Azure, the [url=glossary:stonestalker]Stonestalker[/url] tribe will draw strength from his essence.</DefaultText>
