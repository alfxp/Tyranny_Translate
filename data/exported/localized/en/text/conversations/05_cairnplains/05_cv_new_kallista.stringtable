      <DefaultText>"Well, well. Must be my lucky day." The Crimson Spear cocks her helm-hidden face to the side, studying you curiously. 

"The name's Misery. You'd do well to remember it, Fatebinder, as this little town belongs to me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Does he now?"

She cocks her head to one side, whole body primed and ready for a fight near instantly as she eases into a battle stance, spear drawn faster than the blink of an eye. She holds her stance, violence barely contained, as she waits for your cue for how the exchange is going to progress.

"Going to say the Voices wants a word with me in his tent, are you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Heh. You got a funny way of saying you're here to help me."

She shrugs and drops her spear into the sheathe on her back. But she crosses her arms as she regards you, ever wary of an attack.

"Don't fret. I know better than to fail the Voices. I've had my gangs combing the Sea more than four spans now, without sleep. We're close to finding that moaning muckpile."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She falls silent and unnaturally still, taut as a snake arched to strike. Finally, she shirks back, settling the tension between you with a lazy salute.

She lunges for you without further warning, fast as lightning, and followed by a thunderous crack of her spear.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her helmed face cants sharply as she studies you, her lips no doubt twisted into a sneer behind her mask.

"Keep your bloody prize, then. Arabella's the only warning I need at my side. But you? Yeah, you'll need all the trophies you can get." She laughs, but it's a cold and cruel clang from her chest. "Best watch your back as you walk within MY town - brimming with MY fucking gangs. Fatebinder."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, look at you - a Fatebinder, Archon-killer, and queller of quakes - my big fucking hero."

She laughs harshly from behind her helm, sweeping an exaggerated bow. As her foot slides on the stony ground and her arms flourish wide, she whips her spear around hard - barely missing the strike to your abdomen.  

"Whoops," she shrugs as she uprights herself from the bow. "Almost knicked you there. Would be a real shame for you to die now, considering all you've done for the Chorus." </DefaultText>

"If so, I'll have to track him down. And break him."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She doesn't break easily. Even beneath the jut and strength of her helm - even with both of your hands wrapped, squeezing, her throat is wrought as the bronze she wears. And her neck is supple as the spear she wields.

She gurgles a bloody growl. Then bones snap. And her body goes limp - empty.</DefaultText>

The Crimson Spear points her long-handled weapon at you. The bronzed tip bobs and oscillates, slicing at the air as she shouts.

The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] officer hefts his broadsword at the ready, two-handedly gripping the worn leather haft. With a grunt, he works his shoulders to loosen them, heavy iron plates clanking with the circular movement.
