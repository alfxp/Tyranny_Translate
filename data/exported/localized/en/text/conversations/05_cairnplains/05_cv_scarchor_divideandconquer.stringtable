      <DefaultText>"How am I to fight in this?! The breastplate alone weighs more'n a Beast!" With some effort, she clanks and clomps a few steps closer to the group. She wheezes, suit rattling as her muscles tremble from the effort to stay standing. "I can barely breathe in this iron trap!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The man next to her snarls and pounds a meaty fist on his helm. "Bitch harder, you baby. My helmet don't even fit. Thought the lot of them had lumpy stones for noggins, but this thing's sized for a child and tighter than a vise!" He grunts and pries at the iron helm to no avail. "I-I'm not sure I can get it off."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Bite your friggen tongues or I'll cut them out - iron visor or not." She knocks Severed Sophus' visor up to reveal his face then slams it back down to make her point. "Nitwit. Few more raids and we'll have slandered the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] well and keen."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She taps her wooden, splintered and blood-splattered staff on the ground with both impatience and self-satisfaction. "Plus, we've never been fatter on crates. Misery's scheme is -" 

She jolts, noticing your intrusion for the first time. Instinctively, she crouches into a battle-stance, weapon raised before her. "Who the piss are you?!"</DefaultText>

Raven bows low with a mockingly exaggerated sweep of her arm. "We've got plenty of stock to go around - to share with our dear pals, see?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Imbued with an unnatural and sudden strength, the iron-clad soldier roars, rushing forward despite the weight of his armor, despite his previous reluctance. "Kill him!"

He brays with an insatiable blood lust, and behind him Prattle echoes his cry, charging forward to attack.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Blood Chanter relaxes a little too readily, offering you an easy grin. "Well, you can rest easy, weary traveler, cause it ain't us."

She holds her hands up and wriggles her grimy fingers as if to wave off any lingering wariness between you. "So waddle along now - we're on an important mission. Right, soldiers?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"All right! I'll give!" The heavily-clad Chorus soldier clanks to the ground awkwardly as he attempts to bend the knee but fumbles under the unfamiliar weight of the iron suit. "I don't know about them, but I didn't come here to die. I'm only following orders - same as any other."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Blood Chanter's chapped lips part in surprise, but she covers it with a quick lick of her tongue. Then she laughs, hard enough that she clutches for her ribs with one hand and slams the head of her battle-staff against Severed Sophus' already-dented helm with the other. 

"You hear that, you pissants? We're fucking up. Don't tell me we left some poor fool dying by the roadside." </DefaultText>
