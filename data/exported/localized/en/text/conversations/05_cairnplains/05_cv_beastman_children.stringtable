      <DefaultText>Two of the Beastcubs ignore you completely, more interested in pawing at the ground and chasing a skittering bug around. A third one watches you with rapidly dilating pupils, but says nothing.

The fourth shakes his entire body in rejection of your appeal. "Nooo! Bramble doesn't want to follow human. Wants to stay here and play!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Broodmother says cubs can't eat human meat. Says humans are only prey not for eating because humans are bad - sick. But broodmother is not here. And Rivers bit an Elder Teeth stealer when stealer was tossed in brood-hole many days ago." 

The Beastcub grins proudly, her little fangs sharp as blades. 

"Flesh did not make cub sick. Did not taste bad. Please, please! Beastling wants to try bigger bite. Wants to eat strange, dangerous prey." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The four, young [url=glossary:stonestalker]Stonestalker[/url] whelps hardly seem to notice their broodmother's absence, howling and giggling as they scamper about - utterly absorbed in their rambunctious play session. 

They are unaware of their own precariousness, their vulnerability. Darkly, the thought presses on you that if you're going to deliver the cubs to Octave, now may be your best chance.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yay, pack-friend! Playmate is back! Playmate has treat for Beastlings?"

One of the Beastcubs playfully tackles and nips at her packmate, causing the former to growl and snap back in response.

"Rah! Stop!" 

The two grapple and tear at each other excitedly on the ground, instantly forgetting your presence.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The whelps wriggle and squeal with delight. You barely have time to toss the loosely bundled limbs onto the ground before they pounce and scarf at the meat. Tiny fangs bloodied and stuck with bits of gore, they rip and gnaw at the meat savagely.

After satiating their hunger they upturn little smiling, red-smeared faces, happy and eager to follow you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you approach the bridge, the cubs hesitate. After all, it's both the first and the farthest they've ventured from their tribe's den.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Beastcub who has been watching intently, stalks closer to you. She offers you a sly smile. 

"Rivers will follow Fatebinder. Rivers likes human's scent. Smells different. Have not eaten human before."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The furry little whelp hunches onto her front paws, sulking even as she scampers closer.

"Cub was only curious. Only wanted small taste."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Two of the Beastcubs ignore you completely, more interested in pawing at the ground and chasing a skittering bug around. A third one watches you with rapidly dilating pupils, but says nothing.

The fourth shakes his entire body in rejection of your command. "Nooo! Bramble will not obey Fatebinder! Beastlings only listen to broodmother!" 

The Beastcub growls and bares his fangs. "Go away, stinky human!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Beastcub visibly trembles, hackles raised and growling as he crouches and backs a short distance away. His eyes are impossibly large in his face as he watches you for any sudden moves.

"Cub does not like Fatebinder. Is mean to Beastlings! No, Rivers! Stay back!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>One of the whelps, Bramble, watches you with an earned wariness, but shortly perks up as well, unable to resist his curiosity. He slyly inches closer, fingers playing in the dirt at your feet. He licks his lips in anticipation.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>At first the Beastcubs fail to notice you, too locked in their wild, rough fray, gleefully gnawing on each other's ears, punching and rolling on the ground. Then the one named Rivers shakes herself loose and lopes up to you.

"Fatebinder has come back! Fatebinder has treat for Beastlings?"

One of the Beastcubs playfully tackles and nips at her packmate, causing the former to growl and snap back in response.

"Rah! Stop!" 

The two grapple and tear at each other excitedly on the ground, instantly forgetting your presence.</DefaultText>
