      <DefaultText>"But the [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url] seem to have other plans. When we got further in, they were already there, guarding the shards.

Look, I know I'm breaking my work order with the Earthshakers, but it's not like we made it a real, legal contract or nothing. I swear, it was just a handshake!
