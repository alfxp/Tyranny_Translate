      <DefaultText>"Wander no closer, human. Flee now or explain presence in Stone-lands." The Beastman hunkers forward, muscles bunching in readiness to strike. A menacing growl rumbles low from the back of his throat. "Even mention tribe's Elder Teeth and Beastmen will pitch human's body to ground below."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Beastman slits his silvered eyes, wary. He sits back on his haunches, but his muscles jump with a mixture of excitement and fear - thrill and terror. He lolls a pale tongue out the side of his mouth, smirking.

      <DefaultText>The Beastman slits his silvered eyes, suspicious. He leans closer, warm, gnarled fingers enclosing your throat as he snuffs up and across your exposed skin. A rough, dry tongue laves behind your ear before finally, the Beastman withdraws, satisfied.

"Humans cannot be kith. Yet human does not taste of lie. Tastes of tribe." He nods once, pert. "Enter. Speak with Red-Fang. But know Beastmen will watch with sharp eyes. Will rend human to shreds if human strikes at tribemate."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Beastman studies you for several moments with slitted, silvered eyes. He snuffs and snorts. Finally, he sits back on his haunches, but rather than relaxing, his muscles jump with a mixture of excitement and fear - thrill and terror.
 
"Human smells of truth and strength and tribe. Smells of old [url=glossary:prima]Prima[/url]'s defeat. Enter human who leads [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url]."</DefaultText>
