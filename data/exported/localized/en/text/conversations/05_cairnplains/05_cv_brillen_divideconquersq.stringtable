      <DefaultText>"Scout reported from the civvies - a rash of caravans had been despoiled by [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] troops. 'Course it wasn't us, so me and Isod got detail to track the problem. Didn't know then a squad of Shields was missing."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Tracked the bastards a few days. Found the squad's bodies some leagues downhill. Thought to turn back, but two of the Shields - they meant something to Isod. So I let him press us on."

He grunts as he pops his leg, resetting the shattered bone.

"We kicked a damn hornet's nest of Chorus. They've been sniping our guys, a few at a time, using our armor to raid the caravans.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Chorus are smearing our name. If it was just my reputation on the line, so be it. But I can't let them do this to the General. He suffers enough for us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They can't be far gone. Tracks there," he points to the left, "are headed North."

He slumps and curses, beaded with sweat. "You find those Scarlet bastards, be sure to give them my regards from Ashe. Right before you cut their pissing cocks off."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A Fatebinder... out here?" The man lifts his head, regarding you blearily. Stripped of his armor, you can see several jagged wounds to his throat, belly, and thighs. Any one of them should be fatal, yet the man is very clearly alive.

"Thank [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]. I thought the bastards had doubled back to kill me... again."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I blacked out from the blood loss. [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] that's embarrassing. Thought I was a goner."

He glances to the body of the man next to him and his face hardens. He clenches his jaw in anger and something colder - regret.

"Isod wasn't so lucky, I guess."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Who do you think bears the burden of our pain? Who makes us stronger than our enemies? Well, not that I'm even sure of it... but I've heard things. That there's a cost."

He grunts and tips his head back almost as if he's given up - as if he's willing himself to die.

"If so, why let me survive?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He rakes a bloodstained hand through his hair and grunts. "I'll live. But I don't care a rat's prick about that right now." 

He glances to the body of the man next to him and his face hardens. He clenches his jaw in anger and something colder - regret.

"What I want's justice."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Best iron-clads are dead iron-clads." The Beastwoman smacks her lips, long tongue slathered with saliva and lolling between her fangs as she eyes the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url], longingly. "Beastwoman will devour iron-clads liver... to ensure iron-clad is truly dead."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Just think of all the wounded and injured people he's slaughtered in his long and glorious career with the legion." With a satisfied grunt, Eb jabs the butt of her staff into Brillen's body. "One down. How many thousand to go?"</DefaultText>

He grimaces a pained grin, then swearing and shaking, he stumbles to his feet, cracks a shoulder and shuffles sluggishly toward the distance.

"I won't forget what you've done, Fatebinder," he shouts to inform you, waving a two-fingered salute in farewell before he disappears over the bridge. "I'll tell the lieutenant and the others at Jagged Maw what you've done for us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The groan he unleashes is so painfilled that for a moment it seems as if the battered soldier really will keel over and die. But then, swearing and shaking, he stumbles to his feet, cracks a shoulder and heads sluggishly off into the distance.

"I'll have to report to the lieutenant at Jagged Maw that I've failed. We'll redouble our efforts," he shouts to inform you, waving a hand in farewell before he disappears over the bridge.</DefaultText>
