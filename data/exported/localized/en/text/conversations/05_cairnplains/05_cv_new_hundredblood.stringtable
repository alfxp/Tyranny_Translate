The leader of the [url=glossary:stonestalker]Stonestalker[/url] tribe furrows her brow at your approach, feral, amber eyes tracking your every step.

"Who approaches Hundred-Blood, strongest in all Stone-lands, first Free-Prowler, Beastwoman who reaches without bounds, mystic, and [url=glossary:prima]Prima[/url] to [url=glossary:stonestalker]Stonestalker[/url] tribe?" 

She sniffs deeply, nostrils flared as she parses your scent.</DefaultText>

She peels the rest of the scab free and eats it with a prim sniff.

Hundred-Blood pins you with unforgiving, wild eyes.

"After some seasons, Runt-Hound slunk away in shadow of half-moon. Understand? When Beastmen become Caitiffs of tribe, [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url] do not track or think of as lost. Only think of as gone."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She flinches against the spray of grit then snorts harshly to clear her snout.

"Human," she spats in a hollow warning, ired but helpless. "Why has human hunted [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url]? What does human desire from Hundred-Blood?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Only humans trade for trinkets. [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url] do not hunt for shiny baubles. But some trophies can be earned - human must pine for [url=glossary:prima]Prima[/url]'s own pride, for Shield that was taken from toughest human in Stone-lands."

She flares her nostrils, defiant. "Can search Hundred-Blood's corpse. Can dig all through stone den. But [url=glossary:prima]Prima[/url] will not so easily give Shield to human."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She snorts, amused. "As if human does not know. Yes, Hundred-Blood speaks of Shield that belonged that to humans called Tiersmen's toughest protector in all of Stone-lands. Is mystic-shield that Chorus pests have sniffed and dug ceaslessly for - but cannot find."

She licks her fangs, feeling particularly self-pleased.

"Because Shield belongs now to great [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The monsterous Beastwoman rises on her hind legs, towering over you in her full height. Her muscles quiver as she snarls loudly and snaps her teeth. 

Her swelling magic bites at your skin, and the mountain side howls as it stretches and cracks beneath the press of her strength.

"Why?! Why would human kill Red-Fang?!"</DefaultText>

She bares her thick fangs at you, furious, but slowly her rage and power begin to dissipate. Growling low, she eases back onto her haunches and considers your words.

"But Fatebinder is not wrong. If human who smells of Alpha could best Red-Fang in fair battle, then human has right to pride. Right to Beastwoman's respect."</DefaultText>
