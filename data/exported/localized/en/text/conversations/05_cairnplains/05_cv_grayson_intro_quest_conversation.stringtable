"After the destruction here, he headed out into the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url] and that's where he still lies. His body turned to stone and the story is he's trapped. That's what is causing the earthquakes - his ongoing death throes are tearing our land apart.

"If bad humans. If first attacked Beastman. If smell strange or smell good. If loud and annoying. If look meaty enough, lost, or won't be missed."

      <DefaultText>"I'm not opposed to it. If it weren't for them having sighted the Beast days before and laying out the traps, we'd have never caught him anyway."

      <DefaultText>"Yeah, that giant of an Archon. He kept moaning and groaning as he made his way across the land. Left destruction in his wake and riled up the Beastmen something fierce. Believe he fell near the Dawning Spire?" He gives his head a scratch, pondering the situation.</DefaultText>
