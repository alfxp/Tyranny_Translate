      <DefaultText>"Well, I'm your man for anything you need. Weapons? Got a few that work. [url=glossary:armor]Armor[/url]? Long as you like it nicked. Need a sheep? I got sheep."

"I also trade in relics, but haven't got my hands on a good one in a long while. Although... maybe you could change that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"When Azure split into the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url], the plains surged about, instantly ravaged. A lot of people got swallowed. A lot of settlements got spit out. Now, it's a sad history, but the rest of us - we've got to live on. Draw our own destinies." 

Arason rubs his shaking and gnarled, liver-spotted hands together. He licks dry, chapped lips.

"You've heard of the Everwell, haven't you? Well, it's rumored to have recently surfaced in the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Not only is it bejeweled, but the Everwell's a relic of arcane origins. Every Azurian knows the tales of the blue inkwell that never ran dry, that disappeared in a splash of stone during the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]. Should think the Sages would pay a pretty penny for such a fine tool. Find it, and we'll be swimming in ink and rings."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If these ears heard true, you ought to start in Stone Down. This'll be good, you'll see. I've never peddled an enchanted item of such power before. I heard once that the Everwell was spilled and damn near sprang a lake before it could be righted."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No, not really. The population's withered like a dry vine, but business keeps steady enough. There's plenty of travelers who pass by on their way to Azure's plains."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Azure's not the safest place to live no more. Most folks in [Plainsgate] died or fled during the tumult, though admittedly we didn't get the brunt of it. Anyway, those that were left soon turned eye to the riches scattered on the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url]'s floor." 

The old man scratches a spindly shoulder.

"Few keep around long enough to settle the city these days."</DefaultText>

      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Not many. The [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url]'s floor is dangerous, and folks often perish while wading for lost treasures. Used to be farmland. A rolling, green bed as far as the eye could see. Fed the whole of the Realms."

The old man shakes his head sadly. "Now look at her. Nothing but rock shards and ruin."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I heard the stories about [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]'s fall - heaving and hollering, doubled-over, and wracking the ground with every footstep. Eventually, he got down to crawling, moaning like a pregnant sow. Shuddered and fell flat at Howling Rock. That's when the ground tried to swallow him. City's been rumbling ever since."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The way I heard the tale, the Everwell was originally made by the Sages, but in 238, [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] Parsing Lark offended the Queen of Azure on a visit and never came back alive. Since the Everwell happened to be close enough to Azure in color to amuse the Queen, she kept the relic for herself, then used it to write the Sages a thank you note for the gift. We stole it back in 246, then somehow lost it again in 350 in what I can assume is a manner so humiliating and dimwitted that my brethren couldn't bring themselves to note why in the histories..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] nearly snuffed out the little spirit the people of [Plainsgate] had left since the blight began. I can see a glimmer of hope returning to them now. I'd like to show my gratitude by offering you a special price on all my wares, Fatebinder."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The old man turns to greet you before suddenly falling silent at the sight of the shield by your side. "I-I apologize Fatebinder, but words escape me... Is that what I think it is?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A single tear drop forms in his eyes. "The stories never did it justice. The Kingdom of Azure had acquired many relics in their time, but none surpassed the beauty of that shield at your side. You would do well to keep it close - that shield has protected many a great warrior in its time."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Old what?!" The man struggles to collect his senses. "That old thing just so happens to be the Azure Shield, the fabled artifact of the Kingdom of Azure!" He shakes his head. "I don't know how you stumbled across it, but I'd take great care of it. You wield years of history at your side."</DefaultText>
