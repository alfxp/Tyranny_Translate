      <DefaultText>When the leader of your home village spoke out of turn one time too many, agents of the Overlord put the whole town to the torch to contain the spread of insubordination. The Bounding Viper tribe came across the smoking ruins of your village, and when the Beasts’ matriarch found you frozen but unafraid, the mighty leader took you in and raised you with the protection of her tribe.

For years you lived with these wild Beastmen in their migratory homes throughout the mountains, but the Bounding Vipers were a dying breed. Each long winter took a greater toll than the last, and once the dwindling tribe was too weak to defend its lands, [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] soldiers came to dispense of the ravenous scavengers your tribe had become. Finding a human amongst the wild tribe, the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] soldiers made a point of taking you alive. News of the wild child of the North eventually spread to the Archon of Justice - and he ordered you released from captivity and delivered unto his court.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With the mercenaries expelled and [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] under new leadership, [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces congratulated themselves on bringing order to the settlement and guaranteeing a productive flow of resources.

Only a token garrison could be left behind while the armies returned to the front.

      <DefaultText>The [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url] was an archive and library of massive scale. Its inhabitants were known as the School of Ink and Quill, a circle of mages that, centuries ago, carved out their own mountainous refuge on lands unsettled by the other major realms.

Legends said that the Citadel housed a treasure trove of arcane knowledge. The Overlord's spies infiltrated the school and confirmed as much. The time was ripe to send a detachment to the great library fortress, and force the scholars to yield to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url].</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Not wishing to pay to feed and house two, the madam that purchased your mother sold you to the Proving Grounds, the Northern Empire's bloodiest, most notorious fighting arena. Given only enough training to assure the show isn’t over too soon, your natural prowess and survival instinct led you to one victory after another. There was no elegant swordplay, no formalized duels - just brutal melee and the stench of blood, shit, and bronze with each day’s gruesome necessities.

It is said that any fighter that slays a dozen others in the grand melee is given her freedom, but in three hundred years, only three warriors have ever walked away from the Proving Grounds. When the closing horns sounded and thirteen corpses lay about your feet, you became the fourth to be granted freedom to thunderous applause - but this autonomy was short-lived. Within days, word of your accomplishment made its way to the Archon of Justice.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Unable to settle the year's accounts with grain, your parents offered you as a tithe to the Overlord instead. Seeing your first battles as a child, you've known all your life how to fight, how to stay calm at the sight of blood and disembowelment, and how to rely on your fellow warriors. Deemed smarter than the average killer, you were groomed for command and given an education in letters and numbers.

With rumors of war, it seemed recruitment into the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] legion would be the obvious match for your skills, but the Archon of Justice is known to say that good iron is not used for swords, and good minds are not used for soldiers. Claimed by [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url], you were instead drafted into the Court of Fatebinders, where your martial skills were put to use in the enforcement of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' laws.</DefaultText>

It is rumored that [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] selects many of his agents from his prisoners - who better to catch the wicked than those versed in such ways? 

In his mercy, [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] offered you the choice of two sentences: decades languishing in prison or a lifetime serving him in the court of Fatebinders. The choice was an easy one, and instead of seeing the inside of a cell, you were trained in letters and numbers, magic and war. The laws you once broke are now yours to interpret and enforce.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url] stood on the northern border between [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Empire and the Tiers. Built upon a natural harbor at the crossroads between realms, the city was a nexus of commerce. To the Tiers, it was the center of all wealth. To a northerner, it was little more than a backwater trading post. Its symbolic status as a gateway to the continent made it a natural first target in [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' military conquest. Circumstances were ideal for you to prove your worth as a soldier in [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' armies.

Taking this city would send a message to the rest of the Tiers: [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' will is insurmountable.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] the Adjudicator entered the palace in unopposed silence. Rather than assume the throne, he instead tapped his gavel to the marble floor. An echo grew in volume, cultivating strength as it travelled through the hall and into the city's foundations. Massive quakes rocked the city. Districts outside of the governing quarter collapsed as the earth swallowed them whole. 

As the demonstration of his power drew to a close, [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] rendered his conquering judgment: "The [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url] once teetered on the whims of the corrupt. Strife and political infighting are at an end. Henceforth, [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' law will define justice."

      <DefaultText>Years ago, Lethian the Bold founded a small merchant town at the intersection of ancient Oldwalls. A pact between the settlers and a mercenary company meant that caravans were able to travel without fear of bandits or Bane, and the town thrived in modest insignificance. 

Lethian’s Crossing drew [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]’ attention for the iron deposits in the surrounding hills. With the region under [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]’ control, the Northern smith-mages could set up workshops to refine ore and arm the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] with the finest weapons in the known world. 

The Archon of Secrets dismantled the mercenary support with a generous bribe, taking the Crossing in a bloodless victory. [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] dispatched you to travel alongside [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces and bring order to the region.</DefaultText>

With its southern position, Stalwart had been largely safe from war - watching for two years as its neighbors fell to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces. On the dawn of the third year of war, [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces were finally poised to invade the Stalwart peninsula, and subdue the Tier's most vaunted army.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The clear skies darkened as you read the final words of the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]. A flurry of wind and rain whipped through the rolling plains and craggy canyons, turning rocks, uprooted trees, and hapless soldiers into hazardous shrapnel. Armed with a measure of foresight, you were able to remove yourself from the area before the storms grew more violent. Over time, nearby communities told of cyclones consisting of thousands of soldiers' worth of limbs, spears, armor, and skulls. What's more, the weather showed no sign of dissipating.

Several units of [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url], who fought the enemy in spite of the advancing storm, were caught up in the Overlord's magic. The few survivors regrouped and nursed their wounds. Their failure to topple the Stalwart legion shamed them into believing the dead more fortunate.

The name 'Stalwart' fell from use. People took to calling it the '[url=glossary:blade grave]Blade Grave[/url],' for the remade landscape festooned with the iron and bronze armaments of two once-great legions.

As [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces departed, you spared a glance back at the ruins of Stalwart, marveling at your work. You didn't have long to rest before [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] called you into service once more...</DefaultText>

One does not apply to be a Fatebinder, one is called by [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] the Archon of Justice, and to decline is death.

The [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] established a sprawling camp in the shattered, rocky terrain - and quickly absorbed those displaced by the upheaval of the land.

      <DefaultText>This template focuses on maximizing your relationship with the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] faction. Over the three years of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Conquest, you traveled to the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url], [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url], and Stalwart.

At the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url] you led a group of [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] scouts to attack an enemy fort, cutting off the city's reinforcements. Later you tricked a group of fire mages into an ambush that led to their deaths. As the city fell, you crossed over the wall and challenged the city's Marshal to a duel, demoralizing the enemy with his death.

As governor of [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url], you enslaved a local tribe of Beastmen to keep the forges producing iron. When members of the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] and [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] demanded preference for the iron weapons and armor, you sided with the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]. Ultimately you granted control of the city to the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url], as they were most likely to maintain order.

In the final year of the war you joined the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] in their bloody march across the Realm of Stalwart. When tensions rose between the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] and the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url], you supported your ally. When a chance came to punish the enemy by using the body of their leader as a message, you helped the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] with the butchering.

At the end, you were chosen to read [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Storms upon the land.</DefaultText>

Over the three years of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Conquest, you traveled to the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url], [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url], and Azure.

At the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url] you fought beside the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] at the Gates of Judgment, ordered that prisoners be conscripted to serve your allies, and helped the Chorus ignite the city into a fiery inferno.

Granted governorship of [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url], you helped the Archon of Song out of a tricky situation, affirmed the right of the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] to recruit from the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url], and granted control of the city to the Chorus.

In the final year of the Conquest you joined the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] in their efforts to tame the land of Azure. You aided them in recruiting packs of Beastmen to their number. When the Archon of Stone betrayed the Overlord, you sent the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] - rivals of the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] - to die.

At [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' order, you read the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Stone that destroyed [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url].</DefaultText>

Over the three years of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Conquest, you traveled to the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url], Apex, and the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url].

In the first year of the Conquest, you led a [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] conscription team that doubled the size of the Horde. When the armies reached the walls of the city, you were already inside - aided by a smuggler you paid to submit to the Overlord's will. During the final battle, you led a team of Chorus and [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] to take the city gates and swing them open, killing the defenders.

Traveling to the land of Apex, you helped the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] defeat a group of water mages and used a captured enemy to convince your opponents to surrender peacefully and bend knee to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url].

In the last year of the war you stood outside the walls of the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url] as the Sages betrayed their promise of surrender and attacked. When the Archon of Song ensnared the will of several mages, you upheld the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url]'s claim to their control.

You were chosen to read [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Fire that turned the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url] into the [url=glossary:burning library]Burning Library[/url].</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Few have the combination of wits and courage to be accomplished casters and warriors, and those cursed with such a combination of talents are invariably pulled from their mundane lives and assigned to the armies of the Archons. Your earliest memories are a painful slog of training, study, lecture, and exhaustion - all the elements of being groomed for battle. You knew better than to ask what became of your family, nor to question the missives allegedly penned by their hand that were part of your earliest lessons in reading.

When you reached adulthood, [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] the Adjudicator came to the barracks and laid claim to your life. Seeing you as too valuable for the crucible of battle, the Archon of Justice deemed your life better spent dedicated to the art of punitive legal remedies. Though you had much to learn in matters of civil discourse, none could deny your bright future as [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s next great enforcer.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Though they would never tell you why, [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] bestowed great wealth upon your family for some unmentioned service, and your parents used this wealth to have you raised far from home - your childhood was a nomadic tour of Terratus with hired tutors and fleeting friendships. Where others had stability and routine, you had a worldly and varied education.

A careless word in a far-flung city landed you in legal trouble, and you were taken before [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] the Adjudicator and made to stand trial. Not only did you plead your innocence, but you turned the accusations around on the accuser for wasting the Court's time, and the Archon of Justice concurred. Amused by your wit, wisdom, and adaptability, [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] claimed you as his newest enforcer.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Deeply proud of your intelligence, your parents always knew you were too smart for a life spent with your hands in the soil. Looking to secure a better future, your parents struck a bargain with the Seven Tree Guild, a small magical order willing to teach you letters, numbers, and magic - if you proved capable.

For several years, you learned much from the mages, mastering reading and writing faster than the rest, and eventually learned the basics of mystic theory and spellcraft. Your magical studies came to an abrupt halt when [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url], Archon of Secrets, deemed the Guild 'a peacetime distraction' that must be disbanded for the upcoming war, its mages assigned to proper armies. While your peers went on to other guilds, your mind was seen as too valuable to be wasted on the armies - instead, your life was claimed by [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url], Archon of Justice.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Born to noble parents, you were groomed for leadership - your youth spent on letters, history, rhetoric, and other matters of culture and statecraft. Though you had wealth and creature comforts, you were expected to grow up quickly and bear the honor of shepherding others through prosperity and war.

When your parents came under accusation of sedition, you were sent to the court of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url], Archon of Justice, to defend your family's actions. Your parents were found guilty - their sentence: the dissolution of the treasonous estate. Eloquently pleading your own ignorance on your family's actions, you negotiated your most important deal yet - immunity from the crimes of your family for the simple cost of swearing fealty to the Archon himself. Despite the unwilling induction, your education and savvy made you a valuable addition to the Archon's cadre of enforcers. And so long as you remain in good standing, your family just might be allowed to live.</DefaultText>

Deciding that enough was enough, you ordered both of the commanders flogged in view of their armies - letting pain and humiliation teach them where reason had failed. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There was no need to coddle the Tiersmen. If Stalwart lacked in peasants to work their fields, then families would be relocated from other parts of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' empire. The details weren't important - all that mattered was bringing the war to a close in a decisive victory, at any cost. To recompense the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] their losses, and to punish the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] for their short-sightedness, you ordered a score of slaves conscripted into the ranks of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' military.

      <DefaultText>The siege went on without the bulk of the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] detachment - a troubling absence that left you wondering in spite of your order. Days after you made your ruling, a resounding clang echoed across the expanse between the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url] and your camp. A team of scouts sent to investigate recovered a crude, iron sculpture shaped in a mockery of [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url]. The materials: the blood-stained armor of your lost soldiers, torn and re-shaped with enemy magic. </DefaultText>

In the end, they agreed to suspend the practice for the remainder of the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url] campaign. Lacking an outlet to settle scores or deal with pent-up hostility, tensions flared between commanders and recruits who were forced to act against their better nature and communicate. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The parchment arrived in a slender case of engraved iron. Written on it, the words of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]’ [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Fire - a spell powerful enough to devastate the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url]. You were instructed to proclaim the words of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] from on high - your voice the final component to the destructive spell. The only condition was that it had to be done while the sun burned in the sky.

You had the choice of when to read the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]. Reading it at sunrise would offer your enemies no warning of the devastation to come. You could also wait until sunset, giving them ample time to flee or make amends.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You read the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] as the new sun rose behind the Citadel, casting a long shadow in its wake. You were the last person to see that hall of knowledge the moment before the devastation.

The earth shook and red-orange light glowed in the foundation of the sprawling Citadel. Bubbling up from under the library, a torrent of lava heaved with explosive force, gushing from the windows and between loose bricks, melting hostile trenches in the surrounding land. The mages awoke to smoke and fire - for most it is already too late. Only a handful of bewildered mages escaped the smoldering collapse of the massive library fortress. [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' will be done.</DefaultText>

Those bearing the title are expected to read instructions and understand the economies of the Realms in which they operate.
