      <DefaultText>Disciplined and battle-hardened, the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] are an elite legion in [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' army. They spearheaded the conquest of the [url=glossary:younger realms]Younger Realms[/url]  - finding themselves always outnumbered, but never outclassed. Led by the steadfast and dutiful [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url], whom they follow with obsessive devotion, they are committed to imposing their interpretation of order upon the relative lawlessness of the Tiers.

The legion only tolerates Northerners in their ranks, priding themselves on their high standards and cultural purity. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The last of the great Northern Generals to stand against the Overlord in ages past, Archon [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] now serves [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] as supreme commander of the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] legion, and is charged with conquering the Tiers.

[url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] shares a powerful bond with the soldiers under his command, and regards each of them as family. The death of a soldier at enemy hands represents a grievous loss to the old General, who bears the burden of his love with mournful stoicism. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] is little more than a gang of thugs and their captive slaves. Rather than organize under commissioned officers, the Chorus follow a hierarchy seemingly ruled by whoever has the bravado to command and defend their position. At the head of this chaotic pecking order, the Archon of Secrets, better known as [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url], treats the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] as his personal army. 

The [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] often suffers tremendous losses after battle, only to swell in the aftermath when captured enemies and collateral prisoners are given the cruel opportunity to join or die. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Known in his official capacity as the Archon of Secrets, [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] is equal parts genius and madman. Rumors abound that he can steal the minds of others, though few (if any) are alive to confirm as much. The subjects of his interrogation are never heard from again, and the Archon is able to recall the memories of his victims with startling accuracy.

He is the inconsistent leader of the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] - vacillating between commanding from the vanguard and directing his armies in absentia. Despite his strange methods, no one doubts that [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] is an accomplished strategist, even suggesting that his madness stems from thinking hundreds, perhaps thousands of steps ahead of his enemies. </DefaultText>

Named for House Vendrien, the ruling dynasty of Apex, the Guard has a reputation for being as resilient and stubborn as the mountains themselves. Ostensibly beaten by [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' armies and forced to surrender in 429, the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url] resurfaced in 431, brazenly defying the Overlord's rule.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Built in the shadow of an Oldwalls junction in the realm of Haven, [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] is a growing trading settlement. The nearby rivers are rich in iron ore, though the locals lack the technology to smelt and forge the element.

In the years following [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' conquest of the Tiers, the population of [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] swelled with refugees fleeing the destruction of their homelands. The presence of the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] mining the iron, along with their guards, makes this makeshift settlement a vital resource for [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' armies.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Realms of Azure, Apex, Stalwart, and Haven are collectively known as the [url=glossary:younger realms]Younger Realms[/url], and together they represent the major political factions of the Tiers. For centuries, the [url=glossary:younger realms]Younger Realms[/url] have battled amongst themselves for control of the Tiers, with every realm having been at war with each other at some point in memorable history.

This lack of unified resistance allowed [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' armies to swiftly conquer the Tiers.</DefaultText>

The magical storms struck the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] and [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] armies during the height of their engagement, now most of what remains is a blighted landscape of discarded armor and weapons, and high winds of rust and human dust.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Named for its position between two realms (the Northern Empire and the Southern Tiers), the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url] (and its surrounding lands, known as the Bastard Tier) is a melting pot of cultures, and a place of commerce and intrigue.

The Tiersmen of the South view the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url] as a place of wealth and excess, but to the people of the Northern Empire, the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url] is little more than a sprawling slum.

[url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] the Adjudicator established his Court in the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url]. From this foothold in the Tiers, he and his Court of Fatebinders impose [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' laws upon the conquered land.</DefaultText>

The [url=glossary:iron guard]Iron Guard[/url] act as [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url]'s chief advisors when the Archon is present, and when he is absent, they speak with his direct authority.

Even the youngest [url=glossary:iron guard]Iron Guard[/url] has years of training and the finest iron the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] mage-smiths can create - making these elite commanders nearly unrivaled on the field of battle.

      <DefaultText>The largest spanning Beast tribe in the entirety of the Tiers, the [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url] of Azure nearly tripled in population during a period of domestication and forced labor in service to the farmers and ranchers of the realm. However, like all Beasts, the [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url] were born wild and yearned to range free, unfettered by humans within their own homeland.

In ancient times the tribe was known as the Meadowkins, but they were denied a name during their centuries of enslavement.

In the turmoil created by [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' invasion of the Tiers and conquest of Azure, the Beasts rebelled and won their freedom. Drawn to the enigmatic presence of [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url], Archon of Stone, the Beasts took the name '[url=glossary:stonestalker]Stonestalker[/url]' as their own.

After [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]'s defeat when [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] proclaimed the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Stone on Azure - creating the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url] - the [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url] retreated into the wilds.

      <DefaultText>Every character has 6 wearable equipment slots: Head, Chest, Gloves, Feet, and two [url=glossary:accessory]Accessory[/url] slots. Each item equipped in one of these slots benefits the character in several ways, including [url=glossary:armor]Armor[/url], [url=glossary:deflection]Deflection[/url], and bonuses to certain skills.

Equippable items fit into different broad categories: Cloth, Leather, Bronze, and Iron. Each of these provide different benefits. Some Talents require a character to have a certain type of item equipped before they will activate, such as requiring that a character wear only Light armor (Cloth or Leather).

In addition, characters have several Quick Item slots for consumables. These slots represent the food, potions, and other substances the character has at the top of their pack. These are the consumable items a character can use during combat. The Bandolier talent upgrades the number of Quick Item slots every character has access to.

      <DefaultText>Items in Tyranny have one of five [url=glossary:quality]Quality[/url] ratings: Common, Fine, Superior, Exquisite, and Masterwork. As an item's quality rating improves, so do its effects. Weapons deal more damage, [url=glossary:armor]Armor[/url] becomes more protective, etc. Item quality can be improved with the Forge upgrade.

Items of Common, Fine, and Superior [url=glossary:quality]Quality[/url] can be found on the bodies of enemies or in stores throughout Tyranny. Some locked chests will contain the occasional Exquisite item. The only way to obtain a Masterwork item is to improve it yourself.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Every character has up to four [url=glossary:weapon sets]Weapon Sets[/url] they can swap between during combat. All characters start with two [url=glossary:weapon sets]Weapon Sets[/url] available. The Abundant Arms Talent allows all party members to access additional [url=glossary:weapon sets]Weapon Sets[/url].

Each Weapon Set requires a Primary Weapon. If that Primary Weapon is Two Handed (e.g. large swords or maces, a magic staff, or a bow), then no additional items can be added to the Weapon Set. If the Primary Weapon is One Handed (e.g. small swords, daggers, or thrown javelins) then a Secondary Item can be added to the Weapon Set (e.g. a shield or a second One Handed weapon).

Shields are Off-hand weapons, meaning they can only be equipped in the Secondary slot within a Weapon Set.

Characters can swap between [url=glossary:weapon sets]Weapon Sets[/url] during combat, but will incur a [url=glossary:recovery]Recovery[/url] Penalty for doing so.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>All attacks in Tyranny compare the attacker's [url=glossary:accuracy]Accuracy[/url] value to one of five defenses: [url=glossary:parry]Parry[/url] (direct melee attacks), [url=glossary:dodge]Dodge[/url] (direct ranged attacks), Endurance (body system attacks like Stun and [url=glossary:prone]Prone[/url]), Will (mental attacks), and Magic (attacks from spells and spell-like abilities).

[url=glossary:accuracy]Accuracy[/url] is defined primarily by the attacker's skill with that type of attack (weapon skills for physical attacks, magic skills for spell attacks, etc.). It can be influenced by [url=glossary:finesse]Finesse[/url], Talents, and other active effects such as spells or items.

When an attack is made, the attacker's [url=glossary:accuracy]Accuracy[/url] is compared to the appropriate defense on the target to determine how the attack roll will be modified. If [url=glossary:accuracy]Accuracy[/url] is above the target's defense, it will be more likely to result in a Hit or [url=glossary:crit]Crit[/url], less likely to result in a Graze or Miss.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Afflictions are explicitly bundled sets of status effects that can be applied to, suspended, or fully removed from a character. While some afflictions have explicit overriding or exclusivity rules, most afflictions can co-exist with other afflictions.

When a spell is cast on a target, it and its subordinate effects and afflictions are all bundled together in a procedurally-bundled container created by the spell.

If these procedurally-bundled containers are applied while an identical version is in effect, the new version replaces the old.

No matter how many effects are on the target, generally only the best bonuses and the worst penalties are applied.

Some enemies can be immune to one or more afflictions. If so, these afflictions cannot be applied to those enemies.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>When an attack hits, armor is the primary means of reducing damage. [url=glossary:armor]Armor[/url] is usually derived from equipped items - primarily in the Chest and Helmet slots, though spells, Talents, and potions can increase a character's armor.

[url=glossary:armor]Armor[/url] is subtracted directly from all incoming damage. E.g., an attack that initially does 20 damage to a target with 7 [url=glossary:armor]Armor[/url] would be reduced to 13. [url=glossary:armor]Armor[/url] can never reduce incoming damage below 1.

Note that many pieces of equipment will grant different [url=glossary:armor]Armor[/url] values against the different [url=glossary:damage types]Damage Types[/url].

Some types of attacks, such as Damage Over Time effects ([url=glossary:burning]Burning[/url], Poison, etc.) and weapon attack Procs are only reduced by 25% of the target's [url=glossary:armor]Armor[/url] value.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>When a character is attacked and the hit result has been determined, the target's [url=glossary:deflection]Deflection[/url] percentage is checked. [url=glossary:deflection]Deflection[/url] can reduce an attack by one hit result (e.g. a Graze can convert to a Miss).

[url=glossary:deflection]Deflection[/url] is a property of equippable clothing and [url=glossary:armor]Armor[/url] and is also present in talents and abilities. Each modifier to a character's [url=glossary:deflection]Deflection[/url] lists the type of hit result it converts, as well as the percentage chance it will do so when the character is struck. The types of [url=glossary:deflection]Deflection[/url] are:

If characters break [url=glossary:engagement]Engagement[/url], they have a limited amount of time before the enemy they Disengaged can attempt to re-Engage.

Some afflictions make it impossible for a character to Engage an enemy. [url=glossary:paralyzed]Paralyzed[/url], [url=glossary:petrified]Petrified[/url], [url=glossary:prone]Prone[/url], and [url=glossary:stunned]Stunned[/url] all automatically drop [url=glossary:engagement]Engagement[/url] and can be used to get out of trouble.

Generally, a character can only Engage one other character in combat. Some Talents can increase this number, and some active Abilities can make it impossible for a character to be Engaged by anyone.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Archon is the title given to people who wield immense power. It is also a title in [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' hierarchy (the rank immediately and distantly below the Overlord). In modern times every living Archon either swears fealty to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] or lives the nasty, brutish, and short life of a hunted animal. 

While all Archons possess magical powers, there is no other common thread between these women and men. An Archon might be made of fire, capable of conjuring storms, or able to heal with a touch - the only defining trait of an Archon is that this magic power originates from within. It is unclear how Archons come into their powers, but it is generally understood that most grow into or develop magical power throughout their lives, with only a few notable exceptions (such as Sirin, Archon of Song) having shown powers seemingly from birth.

Mages view Archons as the pioneers of magic, as any and all spells that 'mere mages' (that is, non-Archons) can cast all work by tapping into the power of an Archon that has come before - an act often referred to a signing a spell or invoking a sigil. For example, the Earthshaker Guild developed their earth-controlling spells from [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url], Archon of Stone, while many of the Blood Chanter spells of frenzy and fear are adapted from the power of Sirin, Archon of Song. As there have been many Archons to wield similar powers (at least a half dozen Archons of Fire are known through history) it is possible that two mages might invoke different Archons to accomplish similar effects.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Bronze weapons and armor have been the standard on Terratus for centuries. Only the most skilled smiths can reliably blend the correct ratio of copper, tin, and other materials to create a bronze alloy durable enough to withstand the rigors of combat.

Bronze weapons are lighter than the heavy iron produced by [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] mage-smiths. And, while bronze weapons can grow dull in prolonged battle, they do not shatter like iron weapons. A dull blade is better than one that splinters in your face!

Though copper can be found in many mines in the Tiers, the only reliable source of tin was from northern merchant caravans who traveled to the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url]. After [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' armies conquered that trading hub, the [url=glossary:younger realms]Younger Realms[/url] of the Tiers were left without the ability to forge new weapons and armor.

The trade requirements and the skill required to create a durable bronze alloy meant that only the wealthiest of Houses and nations could afford to fully armor their soldiers in bronze. This put their soldiers at a distinct disadvantage when faced with the fully iron-clad legions of the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url].</DefaultText>

Each [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] uses magic as a tool to augment their personal craft - most commonly smelting and metalworking but carpenters, tailors, and tanners are found in the ranks - and each mage strives to create that which is impossible with mundane hands.

Most notably, the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] are the sole masters of iron working in the known world. Using spells of fire resistance to wade into the forge fires, the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] can work iron at temperatures no other forge can match, and with a hands-on touch that no mundane smith could hope to achieve. Because of this vital skill, the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] are considered a strategic war asset - their lives regimented and controlled so that the forges may churn out iron arms and armor without debate, delay, or distraction.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Creation of iron weapons and armor is the sole purview of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] mage-smiths. Only they have the knowledge and power to smelt iron ore and retrieve the valuable metal.

This secret of iron has enabled the Overlord to supply vast armies with iron weapons and armor. Where even the wealthiest of nations could only field bronze-clad armies of a few hundred soldiers, [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces number in the tens of thousands.

Unlike bronze weapons, iron arms do not require an alloy to create, making it possible to forge armaments from a single supply of iron ore. While iron is heavier than bronze and tends to shatter, the ease of replacing iron weapons makes them more desirable for [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces.

To maintain the advantage of numbers, the Overlord has decreed knowledge of how to smelt iron forbidden to all but the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url].

      <DefaultText>The standard form of currency in [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Empire is the copper ring. These thin loops of metal are carried on a rope, string, or leather cord worn about the waist or neck. Each ring is not solid - the ends may be pulled apart to remove a ring from the cord and used as payment.

There are three metals used in [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' ring currency: copper, bronze, and iron. 1 bronze ring is equal to the value of 100 copper rings. 1 iron ring is equal to the value of 100 bronze rings. Early in [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Empire, the weight and value of each ring was standardized. Counterfeiting rings in [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Empire is punishable by death.

As rings are used as currency, it is considered vulgar to wear rings as adornment or jewelry. Such decorations are seen as vulgar, and those who wear them are held in contempt.

      <DefaultText>Sigil is the catch-all term for a symbol, rune, or glyph used to channel magic. Most often, a sigil is used to refer to the name of an Archon in this context. Spell casting works on the principle that Archons create new magical phenomena, and mages then imitate these powers - it is the Archon's sigil that a mage must invoke to channel that Archon's power.

Proper spell casting uses not only the core sigil (for example, a ball of fire would need to start with the sigil of the Archon of Fire) but sigils for shape (a 'bolt' sigil in the fireball example) and for various modifications. Skilled mages have been known to uses sigils that prolong, extend, echo, or intensify their spells.</DefaultText>

Many stores sell camping supplies, but supplies can occasionally be found in containers or on enemies. The game's level of difficulty restricts the maximum number of camping supplies you can carry at once. Lower levels of difficulty allow you to carry a greater number.</DefaultText>

As a character uses a skill, they gain experience in that skill. When they gain enough experience, the skill increases in rank. Higher ranks in a skill increase the chance of an action resulting in a critical success, and can overcome higher defenses on enemies.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The calendar of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Empire is divided into 14 Spans. Each Span is 26 days long and is divided into 5 weeks - called Fists - of 5 days each. The last day of the Span is [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Day, a day of rest.

The days of each Fist are named after roles that [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' considers important to the Empire: Warriors' Day, Healers' Day, Judges' Day, Farmers' Day, and Smiths' Day.

The years of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' calendar are counted from the day of the Overlord's First [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] and known as the True Reckoning (TR).

Dates are commonly referred to using the name of the day and the day of the Span. For example: Judges' Day, 18 Span of Blood. 

A less formal usage is to refer to the date by the order of its day in the span. For example: Second Judges' of Frostfall. 

More formal usages will specify the date using the Fist and the year. For example: Smiths' Day, in the Second Fist of the Span of Storms, 428 TR.

The 14 Spans of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Calendar are: Span of Forgefire, Span of Tempering, Span of Storms, Span of Swords, Span of Blood, Span of Conquest, Span of Rapax, Span of Siege, Span of Flames, Span of Reaping, Span of Ruin, Span of Feasting, Span of Shadow, and the Span of Frostfall.</DefaultText>

Aggression and decisive thinking are so highly prized by the Brotherhood that the violent, enigmatic Scourge is the group's mascot - a creature most decent folk consider the stuff of nightmares. The term "Brother" is used for mercenaries of both genders, as the company's title harkens back to the archaic notion of 'living as men' (in Tiers custom, this amounts to releasing all claims to lands) to better assure an employer that the Brotherhood won't covet the realms they're paid to protect.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Realm of Haven was one of the four major nations of the [url=glossary:younger realms]Younger Realms[/url] prior to the Overlord's conquest. The weakest of the four, Haven fell easily to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' armies early in the year 429 TR.

In the years after occupation, Haven became known for the large deposits of iron in its hills and rivers, making it the most strategically valuable locations in [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' empire.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Its vast, fertile plains made Azure the largest of the [url=glossary:younger realms]Younger Realms[/url]. While nominally ruled by a Queen, the nation was in fact ruled by the many barons who owned the farmlands - as well as the people and Beasts who worked the fields.

Azure fell to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' armies in the year 431 TR, after the Archon [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] rebelled against the Overlord. [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] issued an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] that shattered the land, destroying the rich farmlands with devastating earthquakes.</DefaultText>

      <ID>178</ID>
      <DefaultText>A small peninsula in the northwest of Terratus, the Tiers are a backwater of civilization. The Tiers were the last corner of the world to submit to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' rule, and the Overlord's Archons are still establishing firm control over the people of this land.

The Tiers are named for the huge steps of land that lower in elevation from the northern peninsula that connects the Tiers to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Empire down to the ocean in the south.

The Tiers are strategically important to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] for two reasons. First, the Overlord's triremes must pass along the coast of the Tiers to connect the corners of the Empire. Before submitting to the Overlord, the School of Tides would often attack the Empire's merchant ships. Their command of the waves gave them a superior edge in naval battle. This was a major factor in the decision to attack by land, rather than by sea. The destruction of the School of Tides has freed the Overlord's ships to travel to all corners of the Empire.

Second, during the Conquest a large deposit of iron ore was found in the realm of Haven. This deposit is the largest yet discovered in [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Empire - since the Tanavon Mines were destroyed by the Overlord's [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] in 428 TR.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Unofficially established in the second century of human civilization in the Tiers, the Contested Lands are a patch of mountains and forests that changed hands so many times as to become politically undesirable to all of its neighbors. During a particularly long stretch of peace, the Sages of the School of Ink and Quill built the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url], and this has been the only permanent settlement in the Contested Lands to date.

As the School of Ink and Quill grew in prominence, the Contested Lands came under constant threat of invasion from the [url=glossary:younger realms]Younger Realms[/url], but a dangerous game of shifting alliances always assured that the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url] never found itself in the middle of all-out war. This is likely due in no small part to the inhospitable nature of the land - and one's neighbors are less likely to invade if the grass is entirely browned, barren, and prone to blisteringly hot summers.</DefaultText>

During [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' conquest of Stalwart, the Regents refused to surrender even when [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' armies presented terms that would preserve the lives of their people. For their selfishness, they were hunted down and slaughtered - all except for the last Regent, Straydus Herodin, who was trapped within Sentinel Stand Keep by the Overlord's [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url].</DefaultText>

Built from weathered stone, the Oldwalls tower above the land, visible for miles in every direction. Only the Spires reach taller than the Oldwalls.

By [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' law, the Oldwalls are forbidden.

Where there are Oldwalls, there are Bane. No one knows why the magical creatures are attracted to the Oldwalls, but every traveler who strays too near the walls is attacked. Very few who have attempted to enter the Oldwalls ever return alive.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Very little is known about the Bane. They are savage, vicious creatures that attack humans and Beasts on sight. While normal humans can sometimes escape a Bane attack, they will pursue a mage or a Beast to the edges of Terratus.

Sages who have studied the Bane believe that they are creatures of magic. Whether they occur naturally or are created, no one knows. Some Sages speculate that the various forms of Bane are different stages of a life cycle, with the Bane becoming more complex and powerful as it ages.

No one knows why Bane are attracted to the Oldwalls, but everyone knows that travelling near those towering structures guarantees a Bane attack.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Terratus Grave is the larger of Terratus' two moons and is tide locked in orbit above [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Empire.

Its name comes from denizens of eastern Terratus, who see the moon as eternally looming on the western horizon; it is the grave behind which the sun descends each day.

Terratus Grave is of significant importance to the School of Tides, whose mages can harness this light into searing energy, or tap into the moon's pull on the ocean currents.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A Fatebinder is a servant of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] the Adjudicator, Archon of Justice. The Court of Fatebinders are the judges and executioners of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] law. Trained in legal lore as well as martial and magical prowess, Fatebinders have the task of enforcing [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Peace among the factions and Archons of the Overlord's Empire.

While the Overlord's rule is absolute, the Empire is too large for [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] to directly control everyone. Instead, [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] grants authority over different parts of the Empire to the Archons. Some Archons are governors of provinces or military districts, while others control important groups like armies, mage guilds, or specialized agents like the Fatebinders.

Each Archon is granted limited autonomy over their area of control. As long as they serve [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' goals and do not break any of the Overlord's laws, [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] permits the Archons to rule their armies and provinces in a manner of their choosing. Because of this, the Archons and the groups they control will often clash with one another. The Fatebinders were created by [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] to solve these problems.

A Fatebinder's duty is to resolve disputes that arise between the different armies and mage guilds - and sometimes between the Archons themselves.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Northern Empire was the last great nation to fall before the armies of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] the Overlord. Led by Blood Echo, then Archon of War, the Overlord's armies expected the North to fall within a year. They did not count on the tactical brilliance of general [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url].

Outnumbered and cut off from supplies, the great general led his troops in a holding action that stymied all of Blood Echo's plans. It was during this desperate defense that [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] began to manifest the abilities that would allow him to challenge Blood Echo for the mantle of Archon of War.

After defeating Blood Echo, [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] was defeated by several of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Archons and brought before the Overlord in chains. No one knows what [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] said to the general that day, but Ashe emerged a loyal servant of the Overlord. With his surrender, the Northern legions bent knee to the Overlord as well, and the last great Empire of Terratus fell to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' rule.

The remnants of [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url]'s soldiers - those who survived the final battle with Blood Echo - became the core of his [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] legion.

      <DefaultText>The Ladies and Lords of the coastal realm of Haven are known to spend as much energy fighting each other as they do the other realms. In recent generations, many of the coastal cities rebelled and became known as the Free Cities, lawless dots along the coast. The majority of the realm’s political and economic might resided within them, and by the time of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]’ conquest of the Tiers, all major coastal powers had declared independence. This left Haven with an ambiguous ruling structure that could not simultaneously weather political infighting and armed conflict, granting [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]’ forces an easy victory.</DefaultText>
