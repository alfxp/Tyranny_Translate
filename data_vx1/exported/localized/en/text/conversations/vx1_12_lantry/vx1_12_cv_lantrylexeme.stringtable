      <DefaultText>"There was a time when we were inseparable. I learned much of my magic from her, and her from me - we are each other's mentor and student... it is a very special sort of bond."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But it was a relationship that I fouled through my own convictions. In the years before [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' conquest, I urged our School to surrender. And 'urge' is an understatement... 'rabidly advocated' would be a more apt description. Lexeme did not share my assessment of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] or my opinions on what must be done. I was in the dissenting minority, and most felt I was a traitor - Lexeme included."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But I wasn't about to back off from my belief that surrender was the right idea. Considering what came to pass, I feel justified in my stance. While I normally adore being right about things, in this particular case, my tumescent smugness maybe isn't worth the friendships it all cost me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You presume correctly. We were deeply intimate for the better part of fifteen years. The School gave up long ago trying to make rules against fraternization and... well... we took full advantage of living in the modern era of the School of Ink and Quill, when Sages could do away with furtive copulation and the foolish attempts to curb the natural inclination of scholars to rut."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It was her magic I loved most. She was gifted, truly gifted. She could achieve these little accents on her spells that none of us could replicate. At first, I had nothing but envy and hate for her, but somewhere along the line, it became adoration, and I just hoped to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] that if I rubbed up against her enough, maybe some of her talent would rub off onto me... no such luck."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Troubling, deeply troubling. To think this started when she was 'healed' by a Beastwoman. I don't deny mystics exist among the Beasts, but their magic, as far as I know, is always of the more violent, tangible type. So 'healing' magic from a Beastwoman is... unexpected?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My mind leaps to the worst conclusion - that, like a severed arm, the damage is irreversible. Maybe if she got out of the Oldwalls... maybe if she could be drugged into sleep or... I don't know why I keep speculating."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well there are all manner of magics that kill a person slowly... where to begin? I'm more perplexed that she, and by the sound of it, others too - were first healed and then grew ill.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We are but two members of a team spanning generations, but yes, we both contributed to the Chronicles. Long bouts of fieldwork and longer stretches of authoring our findings suited our temperments. My colleagues insisted original research was the way to make a name for myself, but the accounting of everything is a cause greater than us all."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Lexeme saw the Chronicle as half record of things that were, and half record of how things ought to be. To her, each moment we record offers universal insights into how people will act in the future. I take the more modest stance that you can't stand in the same river twice and the same general can't fight the same war twice, so history is of limited predictive power."

      <DefaultText>"There's no single problem with the Chronicles we've found... the issue is more the numerous errors or rather, the fact that these errors seem erroneous in suspiciously regular ways."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's subtle, really - the vast majority of the texts in here are, to the best of my knowledge, accurate. Major events haven't been fabricated, only the supporting details have been... tinkered with."</DefaultText>

      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And then there's the mention of the Sages and their majority faction being in favor of surrender to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]. That's... flattering, because it casts ME in a positive light but... that's not what happened. I had maybe five or six fellows backing my efforts to capitulate. And I know I'm not being modest and misremembering - how it's written isn't really how it happened."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A very good point to consider... for all I know, this isn't the case of any one author mismanaging the facts, but a compounding of slight errors across multiple scholars... I can't rule it out completely, save for the fact that most of the passages that have caused me alarm are in Lexeme's script. I wish I could report otherwise, but I am sadly rather certain she is the cause of most of these troublesome passages."</DefaultText>
