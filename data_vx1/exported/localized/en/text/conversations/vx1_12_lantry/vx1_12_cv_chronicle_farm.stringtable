      <DefaultText>"Ah, the old concealed texts in a pile of pig shit trick... classic." As Lantry approaches the corner of the pen, a pile of hay and animal droppings vanishes, replaced by a stash of scrolls.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Now here's a subject close to my heart: Histories of the School of Ink and Quill! Who doesn't love a little autochronicle? Roll calls, minutes, graduation announcements, publication dates, and... letters! Oh my... I doubt Sages Corran and Ostrek had any idea their correspondences would be immortalized for the records!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well come on now, the central challenge of the Chronicle is that we don't always know what's important for the record until the chance to write it down has passed. The Chronicle aims to record all things large and small. Once we begin to pick and choose what is remembered... well what then becomes the point of this all?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"In a way, all of them. The School was never crowded enough to disappear into anonymity, but as a 'field scholar' of sorts, I was as distant as it gets."

      <DefaultText>During the taking of the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url], you dealt with a great number of the Sages' texts during the debate of what would become of their seized parchment.

      <DefaultText>The text describes a debate between Sages, discussing the [url=lore:riddle_rings]Riddle of Rings[/url], and one [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url], with the familiar name of Lantry, is arguing that the [url=lore:riddle_rings]Riddle of Rings[/url] posits that [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] has already conquered the Tiers.

'For if the Sages speak the language of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url],' Lantry reasoned, 'and use the currency of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], then military conquest is an extraneous formality.'</DefaultText>
