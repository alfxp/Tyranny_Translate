      <DefaultText>"Let's see here... syllabus? Syllabi! Plural. I suppose lesson plans are part of the historical record, my painful memories aside. Oh look, multiplication tables, the triangle proof, all three... four of them?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This isn't how I recall it. I learned about the Harem from a text I purchased back in... Three-eigthy-something... it was never part of our instruction at the School. I mean, most of us knew of the Harem and would tell variations of it at parties, but... it was never a pedagogical tool."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A fair point. Field study occupies most of my life, and it's been... oh my, years since I was responsible for students. It may have been that we changed how we teach things - it's not like the lesson plan never evolves, quite the opposite."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Perhaps this is how things were taught in the final years... but... No. I can say with near-certainty - I'm right, the text is wrong. Well, in this one specific detail."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They teach it east of the Northern Empire as a thought problem for census takers and seneschals to learn geometric progression - the scandalous content is intended to keep the student rigidly focused on the puzzle."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The way I learned it, [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] Primarchus formulated the three triangle proofs decades before [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]. Where [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' rule is ascendant, it's taught differently."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well I... isn't it obvious? It's false witness. I mean, it's false witness for the glory of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]... in a sense. I'm sorry, am I crazy? This IS wrong... right?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"As written here, [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] is credited with the core proof - broken into two similar thought exercises, and Primarchus is said to have been 'inspired' to formulate the two others from [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]. This is either a long lost secret, or more likely, a recent fabrication."</DefaultText>
