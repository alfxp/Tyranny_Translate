      <DefaultText>"Is this? Why yes! A Chronicle stash!" With a beaming smile, Lantry holds aloft a satchel of tomes and scrolls.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Almanac of Azure 420 through 422. If grain yields turn you on, I have some steamy reading for you! Minutes from the Ardent Peace Accords of 419... a snore even by my standards... what else?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And then there's... oh, back to Azure, years 423 through 426 and... well that's odd..." Lantry falls silent, absorbed in reading.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hmmm... this seems... wrong. Read here." Lantry tilts the tome toward you, pointing to a passage of text that has his attention.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"See this page? Well, maybe don't bother with the whole thing, it's rather dense, but here's something fascinating: it's about House Variah and House Pelox having a two span war over who owns some portion of what's now the southwestern [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url].

      <DefaultText>"Tiersmen calling on [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] for favor before a battle? Come on now, that never would have happened! Some fools around here didn't even bother to learn the name of the fearsome general waiting across the isthmus to invade!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes, and this is not the first of these Chronicle fragments to have... questionable details. There is a..." Lantry's voice falters. "Fuck... what exactly am I reading here?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>"This seems trivial, barely worthy of being called deceit. What's the harm?"</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Aside from making a mockery of honest history? I don't see what this accomplishes. Will [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] read this and decide the Tiers aren't so bad after all? Hardly."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That's enough rumination for now. Let's be on our way. With any luck, we may find more of these Chronicle fragments."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Let's look for more of these tomes, maybe there's supporting information elsewhere."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A wise point! Perhaps my knowledge is incomplete, perhaps the other fragments have information that will explain or corroborate what's written here. I should not be so quick to assume I have all the facts!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Whispering half-formed words under his breath, Lantry pores over the texts, rapidly devouring pages of long, flowing handwriting.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No... the rest of it sounds like things I've known to be true, details that are news to me but within the realm of believable... strange, it's just this one passage that screams out at me. The rest... the rest seems like proper Chronicle reporting."</DefaultText>

      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Does the passage have an attribution?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Pains me to say it, but this is most certainly Lexeme's writing. I'd know it anywhere."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"This one is... also authored by Lexeme. I could tell by her scrawl, but the signature seals the deal."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Can you tell when this was written? Was it penned 'back then' or is it more recent?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh, a good question to ask." With a twirl of the hand he produces a dry quill and scrapes at the ink written along the Chronicle margins.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Minimal flaking for a dark umber ink - probably not more than a few years old... not encouraging." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It seems worth asking if possibly the Chronicle is correct and you are wrong?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I... think it within the realm of possibility but not probability. Yet..." The old [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] balls his fist, unable to find the words.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No, it logically contradicts too much of what I know to be true."</DefaultText>

      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Were the Tiersmen wise enough to venerate the Great General and to properly fear him and understand his teachings, they would have presented a more significant challenge. Or surrendered well in advance. Either way, this claim is ridiculous."</DefaultText>

      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We grew up on stories of Archon [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] same as anyone. Except in our tales, he's a conquered coward who gives in to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] and damns his people in the bargain. So yeah, not exactly someone you call on as a patron of warfare."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"This is pure fabrication - even those inbred Azure-types had no reason to view [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] as a patron or hero. I know, you're so surprised Eb thinks the Sages are writing lies, but I have to call Beast crap on this one."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"So two tribes of Tiersmen have a fight and they... invoke [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url]'s name before the fight? That seems in error."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Exactly! That feud happened by many accounts, but the way it's described here? Nonsense!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If the problem is that you said something on this page was fascinating, then yes. Every bit of this is dreadfully boring."</DefaultText>

      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yes, well, there's a detail here that seems... sorry to use such harsh language about a Chronicle text but... it's dubious poppycock! There, I said it."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"My memory, it seems. But this is the very reason we write the Chronicle - parchment, cared for properly, outlives recollection."</DefaultText>

      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The mind is the first to go, or so they say. I guess I... read of it differently? This is my fault for being so far from a good book for so long - my learning is starting to rust."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Agreed." With a nod, Lantry begins turning through the pages.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>62</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You keep suggesting that... and given my duty to the true accounting of all things, it seems the right move. When we're back at the Spire, the record will be corrected."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm starting to think that's maybe for the best given what we've been seeing." Lantry reaches for a quill before thinking twice.</DefaultText>

      <ID>64</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I could and... and I will I just... I'll make a note to return to this. Until I know why this was edited as such, I'd just assume not tamper further."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With the various scrolls tucked about his bandoleer, Lantry feigns collapse under the burden, then steadies his balance with a smile.</DefaultText>
