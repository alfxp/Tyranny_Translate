      <DefaultText>A second [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] stands before you, this one a familiar face: Lexeme.

      <DefaultText>Your hands slowly trace the same patterns, your body still lagging from the berry's debilitating effects. Try as you might, you can't seem to work any magic from the gesture, though you conclude that, in theory at least, she would be casting a simple illumination spell.
