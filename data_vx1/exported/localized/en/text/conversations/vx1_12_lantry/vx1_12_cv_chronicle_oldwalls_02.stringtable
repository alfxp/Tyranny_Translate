      <DefaultText>"Well have a look at this!" Lantry's eyes widen with glee as he holds aloft a tome of bound parchments.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Found another one! This should be enlightening." Lantry smiles victoriously as he hefts a weighty parchment tome.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Festival of Nerat? Since when was... oh... since 419. Since 419?! Well why is this the first I'm hearing of this Tiers-wide celebration?" He flips through the remaining pages, his eyes rapidly scanning the text with a series of grimaces and grumbles.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's all very fascinating to a historian like me but... I'm sure this is of little interest to you. We can move on." Lantry taps at the cover of the tome, his face lost in thought.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"All this effort to stash old almanacs? Are you sure there's nothing else in those pages?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But of course!" He hands you the heavy tome, and you begin to flip though the pages, your eyes scanning along page after page of flowing text, most of it in changing inks and handwriting styles.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>The tome is as Lantry described: filled to the brim with stories of feasts and festivals, including such details as guests in attendance and wines served.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>Each turn of the page reveals more and more notes on celebrations and festivals major and minor. Your head swims with the names and dates of countless past festivities until at last you arrive at the end cover, your eyes heavy from skimming uneven handwriting.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I suppose it's a quaint collection of what the Tiers used to have by way of festivals."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm weak on my Tiersman scripts, but this passage says 'Festival of Nerat.' Odd, right?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Nerat? What? Hand me that!" Lantry tugs the tome from your grasp and furiously skims the passages in question.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Hmm? Yes, well..." With a hoarse grumble, Lantry flips back to earlier in the tome and begins paging through in a more measured pace.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That it is... memories of a trampled culture... notes regarding life before [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]... preserving the past is a thankless job, but someone has to do it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A festival to Nerat ten years before the Conquest? Seems unlikely..."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well, what does it say about this 'Festival of Nerat?'"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Both [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] and Nerat have spent decades readying for this war, but if there had been recruiting festivals in the Tiers as far back as 419... that's... how is this the first I'm hearing of it?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well how long have you been spying for Nerat? I bet it's been since before 419..."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>

      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Not least of all because when the Chorus entered the Tiers in 427, it consisted entirely of Northerners. Tiersmen weren't recruited until the gangs began conquering. That's basically Nerat's whole modus operandi... crack them on the head and drag them away."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Unlikely! Pardon my Ardent-speak, but it's fucking absurd!"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Let's see... group melees, feats of strength, a drunken feast... if you ask me, it sounds like Midsummer as the Apex folk celebrate it, only with... Chorus details? Things Nerat would like? Or the subset of things he'd like that won't permanently scar children."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Also, it seems like the more someone knows of Nerat, the more likely they can resist my suggestions to join its army. Part of why my 'recruitment' efforts were so successful early on is that few knew I was... forcing them to follow a true monster."</DefaultText>

      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Seems pretty boring stuff. Why such effort to save it all?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"This... this isn't accurate. Why would someone-?" Lantry drops his hand into his palm, letting out a muted, raspy groan.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You are correct, agents like me have sent missives to Nerat for decades but... this is very public recruitment... not something that would escape notice."</DefaultText>

      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You could correct the record."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I think the 'why' is obvious. This creates a pretense that Tiersmen have been worshiping or loyal to the Archon of Secrets, voluntarily, before the war."</DefaultText>

      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Purpose? The only purpose the Chronicle serves is the retelling of it all. It is a cardinal sin of our craft to modify the telling, regardless of purpose."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Seems obvious that Lexeme wanted me to find a record of the Sages and Tiersmen accepting the Chorus and by extension, [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>

      <DefaultText>"Do you think it's ever acceptable to lie to save lives? This Chronicle seems an attempt at just that."</DefaultText>

      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm starting to think that's maybe for the best given what we've been seeing." Lantry reaches for a quill before thinking twice.</DefaultText>

      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I could and... and I will I just... I'll make a note to return to this. Until I know why this was edited as such, I'd just assume not tamper further."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With the various scrolls tucked about his bandoleer, Lantry feigns collapse under the burden, then steadies his balance with a smile.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Some of these pages are missing but... not like I expected these would all be pristine. It's pages of Tiersman cultural studies... doubt you'd find any of this intriguing."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well I... I don't... perhaps if the lie isn't forever. Lying to a child to calm him down is one thing but... this just different. Entirely different!"</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yes but... that doesn't mean we can stop the endeavor! The loss of our texts means we must care all the more about every detail that IS preserved!"</DefaultText>

      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>"There might be... some truth to that." Lantry's gaze falls to the ground, and a soft sigh escapes his lips.</DefaultText>
