      <DefaultText>The Archon's head spins slowly, each time its face passes you, the expression on the mask becomes more and more twisted and taught, until at last its features are no longer a face.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A calm of tranquil haze creeps in, unhinging your muscles from your mind. For eight days the Archon of Shadows would lurch from the dark, jabbing your posture back into right order at first sign of a slouch. As the berries dissolve your motor control, the muscle memories of those eight miserable days rush in to fill the void.</DefaultText>

While the faces come and go, one figure emerges from the noise, unwilling to dissipate into the fog of the past.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Then we have a deal? You will receive further instructions by way of missive. We will use a plethora of names when writing to you, but you will know us by our seal." 

The form of [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url], Archon of Secret congeals from the visions, [url=lore:berrynerat1]flipping his scepter as he paces triumphantly.[/url] His attention seems directed at Lantry, who appears far younger than you ever remember seeing him, though his white features and wrinkles momentarily flash in and out of view.</DefaultText>

[url=glossary:the voices of nerat]The Voices of Nerat[/url] turns its head until one face is squarely looking at you, the other at Lantry. The Archon emits a hearty chuckle as it juggles its scepter.</DefaultText>
