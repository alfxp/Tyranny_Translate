      <DefaultText>Your progress is arrested by the appearance of a gang in crimson and leather who round the corner ahead of you. "Oh shit," Verse mutters. "The Ass Gang." She shrugs at your questioning glance. "I ran with them for a bit."

They note you and approach, weapons at ease. The foremost gang member raises a hand in greeting.</DefaultText>

      <ID>4</ID>
      <DefaultText>You raise your own hand in response, greeting the approaching gang. The leader's head is half-shaven, and a pale sickle of a scar curves down her cheek to the corner of her thin lips.

"Fatebinder," she says, bowing her head slightly. "Verse." Her tone is cold, her eyes narrowed at your Scarlet Fury compatriot. "We don't much care about the slippery loyalty of law dogs - mutts can't help but nip at their betters." Chuckles from the other members of her gang. "But Verse, she betrayed the Chorus. And that demands a scalp."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You immediately charge, leaving Verse blinking behind you. "Wait... really?" She draws her weapon and follows behind you.

The Ass Gang is quick to react, readying weapons and makeshift shields. Their leader belts out a piercing war cry that is echoed by her companions...</DefaultText>

      <ID>9</ID>
      <DefaultText>You give Verse the go ahead and she moves towards them, drawing her bow. A sickle grin splits her mouth. "I've come to kick ass and... well, mostly just that." She lets loose an arrow that buries itself in one of the Warrior's eyes. Tossing her bow aside she leaps into the Ass Gang like a wolf among the herd, blades flashing, deflecting incoming strikes and lashing out to separate flesh from flesh. Shouts and screams fill the air to score her brutal dance.

It's over shockingly quick, Verse breathing heavily above the corpses. She limps, and her right hand clamps the side of her leg, dark blood shining between her fingers.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You draw your weapon and nod to Verse. She matches your movement, and the two of you leap into motion. The Ass Gang is quick to react, readying weapons and makeshift shields. Their leader belts out a piercing war cry that is echoed by her companions...</DefaultText>

      <ID>11</ID>
      <DefaultText>You step between the gang and Verse, your hand going to your weapon. You remind them of your rage and anger at [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url] . Of your actions during the Conquest, the widows you left crying, and the orphans you left alone. Of your choices since. You ask them if they truly want to delay a Fatebinder of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] the Adjudicator over an insignificant matter of pride.

By the time you finish, they've all backed up a pace. With a final glare at Verse, the Choirmen step out of the road to let you pass.</DefaultText>

      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>You let Verse move ahead of you, knowing that the gang's anger is largely focused on her. They take the bait, their attention narrowed on the swirling dance of death before them, and they miss you as you slip up behind. 

Blood flows.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Verse leads the dance of blades and you follow in her wake, a bulwark brooking no interruption from behind. Bronze and iron flash in the sun and blood spatters across the dirt.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Leaving Verse to her own devices you leap boldly into the fray, lashing out at the crimson-clad mongrels as you vent your rage against their leather, bronze, and bone. They crumple beneath your fury in a song of pained gurgles and gasps.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Do you care?" she answers your query with her own. "Seemed like you had your own thing going there." She shrugs. "Not that I'm judging." She looks over the broken remnants of her former gang. "Screw it, let's go."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She runs a hand through the feathers on her head as you reprimand her.

"Finished?" she asks when you wind down. "Look, we all have pasts. I can't promise mine won't catch up with us again. If that's a problem, don't bring me along. I'll figure out some way to get by absent your glorious company." 

She turns towards your destination and moves along.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Much to Verse's protest, you retreat, putting distance between you and the gang.

When you finally catch your breath, Verse gives you a disapproving gaze, and you carry on your journey in silence.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Sorry," Verse answers. "I'm flat out of spare scalps, Clever Ass." 

"The one you're using will do nicely," another member of the gang says.

Verse looks to you. "They want a fight and I'm happy to oblige. Your call, Binder."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You shout at the gang to back off, lest you back them off... with your fists.

They laugh heartily, entirely unimpressed by your bravado.
