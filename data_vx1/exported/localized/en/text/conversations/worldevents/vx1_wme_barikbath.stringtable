      <DefaultText>Along the route towards your destination, the road crosses a small river at a tall, arched bridge. Turquoise water cascades down a three-tiered fall, driving a musty smell of algae into the air, where it mingles with lilac and sage.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'd almost forgotten what 'good' smells like," Verse mutters, eying Barik. She sidles closer to you. "Hey Binder, you know what would be a real service to the Overlord? Getting Rustbucket over there to take a fucking bath already." She pinches the bridge of her nose. "It's been literal YEARS since his last."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Archon of Song inhales deeply, eyes closed, before letting out a prolonged sigh. She looks to you. "Smells nice..." She nods subtly in the direction of Barik. "Quite unlike one of our, ahem, less-than-favored compatriots." Her dark brows knit. "Frankly, Fatebinder, he could use a thorough wetting down."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"As much as I hate the thought of befouling these waters, perhaps you could convince the legionnaire to cleanse a layer or two of filth from his carapace? It would be a nice change of pace for the Tiers' estuaries to wash away some of the Overlord's foulness for once, instead of the reverse."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Kills-in-Shadow's nostrils flare slightly and one of her heavy paws clasps your shoulder. You almost miss her low growl in the babble of the falls. "Even worst hunter could sniff-smell ironclad," she gestures with a long, sharp claw towards Barik, "from the next mountain or farther. Filthiest Beastman in full heat boasts less scent."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The aged chronicler coughs into his hand. "Ah, Fatebinder. This little stream offers us a moment to rest and reflect." He lowers his voice slightly. "And far be it for me to speak ill of your confidantes, but Barik could uh... perhaps benefit from some introduction to hygiene. I don't suppose you might have a word with him? For your own sake if not mine?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The cool, crisp scent contrasts sharply with the sour stench of filth emanating from your [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] companion. You're not sure when Barik last bathed, but you doubt that it was at all recent. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You call a brief respite at the water's edge and make your way to Barik as he fills his water skins. Drawing on your years of experience in court, you craft in artful phrases a gentle reminder that the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] take the maintenance of their kit extremely seriously, and that the most important piece of [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] equipment is their own body. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You call a brief respite at the water's edge, loudly suggesting that everyone take an hour to refill their water skins and refresh their faces. When Barik seems content doing only the former, you force your way closer to him and note that it must be nice for him to be free of his armor and able to once again take care of some basic grooming. He nods along, stating that yes, one could hardly imagine how incredible a clean shave feels after being denied one for years.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You call for a break for refreshment, taking Barik aside. You inform him in a low but commanding tone to get into the water and see to his cleanliness. His reek has begun to hamper morale. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Just asking won't work? So be it. Normally I'd be averse to doing this against his wishes, but he's hardly asked my nose permission to assault it with that stench." Her fingers twist into the complex forms demanded of water-workings as she draws the sigil of Occulted Jade. Her hands trail pale turquoise light hat shimmers like the sun across the river's surface. 

Though its sound draws Barik's attention even as the three-yard long translucent tentacle springs from the surface, he fails to move fast enough to evade its grasp. He hits the ground hard, arms pressed against his body, as the river's undulating arm drags him into the wet.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Kills-in-Shadow's head cants slightly, and she looks between you and Barik. Her lips curl from her teeth in an unsettling grin as she nods. "Yep, yep." In an instant she's bounding across the dry leaves on all fours. Barik barely manages to turn before the beastwoman has him in her paws. With a low grunt and a heave, she sends him arcing (and trailing every one of his limited vocabulary of oaths and obscenities) into the wet.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Sirin grimaces. "Must I?" Her nose wrinkles. "I suppose I benefit from it as much as you..."

She makes her way to the Stone Shield. "Barik," she says sweetly, her sonorous tone slinking through the crevices of your mind and swaddling your thoughts. Barik blinks at her, eyes sliding out of focus as he stares blankly into nothing. "Your filthy reek is putting everyone off their meals. If you don't bathe this very moment, you'll likely see your companions collapse from exhaustion for their lack of food."

Barik nods slowly, then ambles his way slowly into the water.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Stone Shield initially expresses confusion as to your meaning, but then his face flushes as he stammers an apology. "Forgive me, Fatebinder. I'd spent so much... I was encased in... locked away... gotten used to..." He shakes his head. "I shall rectify the issue immediately!" 

He takes off in search of an isolated curve of current, and when he returns, it's without the heady stench that has accompanied him for months.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Of course, Archon! As you will it!" Even as he blushes, Barik's hand claps to his chest in salute, and he trudges off in search of a privacy. When he returns, it is without the odor that had become as constant a companion to him as his twisted armor shell. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He breaks the surface sputtering, water running down his face, as he shouts epithets at the water witch. Eb grins. "If that's how he wants it..." Another gesture engulfs Barik in a tumultuous geyser of fresh water.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Mongrel!" Barik rights himself, water sloughing from his coal-black hair.

Kills-in-Shadows points a clawed finger at him. "Everything in Tiers can smell ironclad. Even mewling beastcub knows to clean self."

You're unsure whether Barik's face flushes in rage or embarrassment, but he wades off to find a more private bend in the river, swearing under his breath.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"In that case, I suppose I shall find a rag. In honesty, a good cleaning and a shave will make me feel a new man."

Barik collects a knife, a nub of soap, and a cloth from his gear, strips to his small clothes, and wades into the water, where you direct his ministrations until the worst of the filth has been removed as thoroughly as his armor. 

Once dressed, he indeed looks like a soldier newly minted.
