      <DefaultText>The pack of Beasts growl, ears twitching, muscles taut and ready to pounce. Their leader, a massive Beastwoman, extends a single long, clawed finger towards you. Her left paw grasps a long spear with a vicious, triangular head.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Before she realizes what's happening, you've wrapped an arm around the Beastwoman's thick throat and forced her head to the dirt. She rears back, lifting you from the ground, but you kick out and catch her in the kneecap. She yelps, your feet again find purchase in the soil, and you sweep her feet out from under her. She hits the ground heavily, and you hold her muzzle to the stone. </DefaultText>
