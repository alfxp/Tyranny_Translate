      <DefaultText>Aside the road ahead you espy a cart. The vehicle is abandoned, with one wheel broken free of its axle. Several crates and sacks remain piled on the small wagon, while a pair of boxes rest in the grass beside it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you approach, you see that the cart boasts four wheels (or did, before the loss of the back left one) and a long leather tack and harness for a Beastman hauler. One of the crates that fell to the ground broke open along its edge, and fruits have spilled out onto the ground.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Climbing onto the cart, you begin cracking open crates, rooting through their contents, and bagging the dozens of fresh fruits and grains within. You even find a keg of fresh beer. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You immediately notice the sundered hauler harness, likely the result of a bladed weapon. The broken wheel, too, appears less the consequence of accident than human endeavor. The spattering of dark, dried blood across the boards cinches your suspicions that this cart came under attack.

Yet the goods remain...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You draw your weapon and enter a defensive crouch, peering towards the tree line in expectation of an ambush. Surely enough, you make out flickers of movement through the brush.

The initiative is yours, however.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You move along the road with haste, eyes always alert for an attack that doesn't come. You quickly leave the cart behind, and after putting safe distance between you and the cart, you resume your journey.</DefaultText>
