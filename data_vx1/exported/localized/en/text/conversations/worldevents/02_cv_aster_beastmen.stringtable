      <DefaultText>The Beastmen look up from the quivering merchant, pale yellow eyes falling on you, taking you in, sizing you up as if judging the quality of a meal. "Human breaks in on cart-haul business. Human should go while still has legs to take it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The cowering merchant shakes his head. "Please! Wait! You're a Fatebinder, right? You have to help me!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A loud slap of paw on skin splits the air as one of the Beastmen backhands the merchant, sending him to his knees. 

The lead Beastman glances back at his packmate, then returns his glowering attention to you. "Go, little human. Now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He blinks rapidly. "You - you're a Fatebinder! You uphold the law! And I'm a citizen!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Of course!" the merchant pants. "And I'd be happy to furnish them, provided that these brutes haven't trampled them into the mud!" He glares unhappily at Beastman that slapped him.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He belts out a harsh bark of laughter. "Oh, of course. I understand, Fatebinder. I'll pay my fair share of taxes if you'll get these things away from me!"</DefaultText>

      <ID>14</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Problem?" The lead Beastman's head tilts slightly, an ear twitching as he gazes down on you. He scratches his belly and snorts. "Problem is man. Man pay rings to Slackneck and pack. Slackneck pack pulls load. But roads stick to feet, to wheels of carts. Man brays constantly. 'Speed up,' he barks. 'Faster, faster.' Insults Slackneck. Insults pack. Pack must answer insults."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Aster Man not worthy of respect." He gestures to you. "Not human of strength and skill, not like human who smells of power and blood."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes, I paid them to haul my goods," the merchant says as he plucks a chunk of mud from his robe. He tosses it into the grass. "And they're making an utter mess of it! Look at my cart axels! And don't start me on the pace! The stars cross the sky faster!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What? Of course he was!" Aster says. "I can't afford to keep slaves, not with the armies dividing up the Tiers and demanding tolls of everyone who tries to cross them!"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>Slackneck watches Aster shout himself out, then turns his yellow eyes to you. "Aster human give rings. Rings buy hauling. Rings don't buy impossible speed. Rings don't buy respect. Rings don't buy insults." He frowns, cocking his head, one claw tapping his chin. "Don't buy insult-listening?" He shakes his head roughly, like a dog shaking off water. "Bronze doesn't let Aster human insult pack!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Insult?" Aster asks, tone acrid. "It's not an insutl to call you slower than Terratus' Grave if it's accurate."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't see how that matters." He folds his arms. "Fine. A bronze each from the Crossing to the Brothers."</DefaultText>

      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>Slackneck nods. "Three bronze rings human dangles like trap-snare. No great treasure horde for long haul."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Slackneck's lip curls back from yellow fangs. "Beastmen strong. Grunts of human [url=glossary:prima]Prima[/url] of [url=glossary:primas]Primas[/url] not matter to Beastmen!"</DefaultText>

      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Double?" Aster spits. He rubs the back of his head. "So be it. Two bronze. Each. Assuming you three can get the carts to the Brothers within the Span."</DefaultText>

      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>Slackneck nods, picking at his teeth with a dirty claw. "Yes. Two bronzes will do. Two bronzes work. Will even listen to mewling for two bronzes." He eyes Aster. "Maybe."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Silence hangs on the air. The Beastmen sink back on their haunches as the merchant gets back to his feet. Two of the Beastmen back away, putting some space between themselves and you.</DefaultText>
