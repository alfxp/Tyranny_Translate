      <DefaultText>You decide to continue along the road. You are a Fatebinder of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url], after all, a representative of the Overlord, and you will not sully your authority by skulking through the forest. As you round the bend, you find yourself looking at not one patrol of warriors, but two.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Apex heraldry and heavy bronze scale marks the first group as members of the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url]. The other warriors, however, wear rings of bronze set in heavy cured leather, a sigil on their tabard styled in the likeness of the Bane. You recognize them from your time as Governor of [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]: these are members of the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url], brutal mercenaries out of Haven.</DefaultText>
