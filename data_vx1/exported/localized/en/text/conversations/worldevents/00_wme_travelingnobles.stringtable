      <DefaultText>Along the road, you cross paths with a trio of Tiersmen clad in the ragged remnants of noble finery. They appear haggard, hands blemished with dirt, faces sunburnt and peeling. Their guard has been reduced to two men in dented bronze, each sporting mangy beards and visible exhaustion.

One of the Tiersmen notes your banner and hails you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With grim stoicism, the woman explains that she, her husband, and his sister travel from their home towards the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url] to bend the knee to the Archon of Justice and swear eternal fealty to the Overlord's glorious rule. Unfortunately, they've been harried incessantly by highwaymen and [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] raiders alike and fear they may not live to see their destination.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Praising their obvious bravery and competence in the face of attacks from the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url], you inform the five that they now serve [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url], Archon of Secrets. Their resistance forces you to kill one of the guardsmen, and a noblewoman loses an eye, but ultimately the group surrenders.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With quiet words of praise to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], the quintet continues their journey. You never learn what becomes of them.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The group is hesitant to accept the terrifying honor of the personal escort of a Fatebinder, but they don't resist your insistence. You lead them to the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url], into the court of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url], Archon of Justice, who presides over the three nobles as they swear their loyalty and service to the empire of the Overlord. After the brief ceremony, one of the nobles approaches you and displays her appreciation in the form of a small gift.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The tired guards fail to react in time to your attack, and they fall to your skilled blows in moments. Blood sprays from an opened neck across the shocked nobles.

The woman straightens and glares at you. She will not beg for her life, she says. You may have conquered her kingdom, but you will never conquer her dignity.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You explain to the group that as a Fatebinder, you serve as an extension of the Adjudicator's court and enforcer of his will. You offer to accept their pledges of fealty in his absence for a nominal fee. They quickly thank you for your offer, and, in a brief ceremony just off of the road, you legally confer on them the benefits of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' Peace in exchange for their oaths of service.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With a single swift motion you end her life, then quickly butcher her companions. You collect the few rings they'd hidden away in their robes before continuing your journey.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The woman blinks in surprise as you tell her and her companions to leave your sight. They don't hesitate, however, in fulfilling your will, and you watch them as they stumble quickly away from you in the direction of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s court.

Bereft of their guards, you doubt they will ever reach their destination.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The brutality you visit upon the woman is matched only by that which she must watch you inflict upon her companions. As you toss aside the broken remains of one of her guardsmen, she begs you to end her suffering.

With the group broken and humbled, you leave the woman to her shuddering sobs as she tries in vain to nurse the others back into fighting shape before the next band of brigands find them.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You demand that the group join your travels until you reach your next destination, claiming that you must protect your vassals on the roads. They acquiesce, and you replace the heraldry of their guards with your own.

The group continues with you to the next town, where you leave them to find their own way home.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your weapons remain sheathed even as you demand the refugees attend your authority as a Fatebinder of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]. Though the woman matches your gaze with steady resolve, the remainder of the quintet exchange nervous glances among themselves.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Via a brief, largely-uncontested interrogation, you learn that these three individuals are members of the old aristocracy of Sunder. They traveled to Stalwart after their homeland's destruction, but the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Storms has driven them north again. Having lost very nearly everything short of their life, they've finally accepted the inevitability of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' control of the Tiers and home to find a place within the new order.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You grant them a decree that should shield them from predation by servants of the Court, but warn them that it will provide no succor from brigands. The guards seem revitalized by even this small respite, and the group resolves to continue on to the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url] to join the court.</DefaultText>
