      <DefaultText>A silhouetted figure stumbles out of the mist before you, his clothes dark and wet with blood. His eyes hold yours for a moment, and his left foot catches in his right sandal, sending him collapsing into a pile of arms and legs at your feet. He rolls onto his back and reaches out for you.

"The Bane!" Blood issues from his lips as he speaks. "They poured out of the shadows, not an hour towards yonder Oldwalls. Killed my men, they did, killed..."

His eyes glass over as he shudders twice more and lies still.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You soon find yourself in the shadow of the towering ancient edifice of the Oldwalls. Continuing along their length, it's not long before you make out the sounds of your quarry, a series of low, grim, wholly unnatural growls punctuated by the constant pops of electrical discharge. Soon you make out the glow of the Bane: a pulsing miasma of wisps, their forms almost indistinguishable from one another as energy crackles among them, backlit by the hateful red glow of a pair of scourges...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Leaving the main road behind, you press through the wilds towards the Oldwalls. As you approach the massive stone structure, you make out the chaotically-swirling, blood-red luminescence of the Bane, their low howls growing in intensity at your approach...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You pick your way across the dry earth towards the nearest Oldwalls. There, beneath the ancient masonry you find... nothing. 

You turn your back on the Oldwalls, wondering if perhaps the Bane had returned to the depths from which they came, when the wind picks up and luminescent motes begin to coalesce around you. The glowing arcane energies adopt the form of vicious claws...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Traveling to the Oldwalls requires ascending a series of steep inclines. You haul yourself up, hand over hand, and find yourself on a ledge overlooking the vast expanse of the Tier below you with the aged structure of the Oldwalls before you. You have no time to enjoy the impressive scenery, however, as the wind takes on a bitterly cold bite. You share this narrow strip of land with the swirling mystical malice of the Bane...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A group of youths about a dozen years of age are at play just outside a ramshackle farming village. Three of the youths wield crude knives and axes carved from solid planks of wood. They face off against a team of younger children with scraps of brightly dyed cloth tied to the wrists, ankles, and necks.
 
They eagerly volunteer that they're playing 'Bane and raiders.' Itâ€™s a local variation of game played by children all across Terratus, in which the armed children attempt to sneak some small treasure (in this case, a shard of well-polished clay) out of an area designated the 'Oldwalls' without being caught by the opposing team, whose members portray the Bane. 

Knowing that such games tend to be most popular in areas where Bane have recently prowled, you ask the youths if there have been any recent sightings. They excitedly inform you that just last week a farmer heard their howling and saw their glow from the direction of the nearby Oldwalls.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You leave camp one morning to empty your bowels when you feel a palpable sense of power on the air. Your skin tingles, prickling into goosebumps, as the hair on your arms stand on end. You go rigid, momentarily forgetting about the pressure in your lower organs, and listen carefully. Surely enough, you soon make out the crackling electric sound of wisps, some of the smallest and least consequential Bane.

Yet you know that wherever the wisps congregate, other, larger Bane are likely to lurk as well. You weigh the decision to investigate or to ignore the Bane and carry on with your travels.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The path bends and a flock of vultures take flight as you come into view of the butchered remains of a caravan team. Their carts appears entirely unlooted - indeed, essentially untouched, save for the blood spatter and organs. The twisted and torn bodies of six mercenaries and three Beastman haulers lay scattered about, each lying in a pool of their own blood, offal, and excrement. Not far away you locate a few merchants in a similar state, their bodies clutching the corpses of their children.

The massacre displays the unthinking savagery of the Bane. While the ephemeral nature of the entities make them difficult to track, you have little doubt that you will find them between the scene of the slaughter and the nearest Oldwalls...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Along a road snaking uncomfortably close to the ancient Oldwalls, you encounter a sign. Splashed across a rock in a thick, tacky red paint, you see a crude pictograph of the kind often made by the semi-literate commoners of the Tiers to communicate basic information. In this case, the message behind the angry mass, shapeless save for its claws and hateful eyes, couldn't be clearer: the Bane have been sighted nearby. 

You could tread carefully and continue towards your destination, or you could make sure this stretch of well-used road remains clear of the Bane's depredations...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You feel its presence well before you approach - an arcane being of such unmitigated hunger and chaos that its influence pervades the very world around it. Whispers play at the back of your mind, and a hateful aggression pushes you forward, perhaps not entirely in accordance with your own will. Its pale blue light filters through the stones and shrubby trees long before you reach the Oldwalls, and it bathes you in its arcane radiance as you enter its clearing. 

The entity swirls before you like a storm of pure arcane power, a handful of other Bane lurking within its baleful iridescence.</DefaultText>
