      <DefaultText>While making your way through the wilderness, you come upon several dense shrubs liberally dotted with crimson berries. The fruits are plump and ripe, with a thin skin that gives slightly under the pressure of your touch, hinting at the juice within.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You recognize the plant as Budding Rose, a bush that produces edible berries. These are a known aphrodisiac, commonly used in local festivals. Unfortunately, they're also mildly toxic to practitioners of magic.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They're delicious," Eb chuckles and plucks a berry from the bush, though you notice she doesn't actually eat it. "They really get the juices flowing. Try one."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This is Budding Rose." He grasps a handful of berries from the bush and stuffs them into his bag. "Consumed even in small quantities, these berries stoke the libidinous humors. Sadly, the berries almost always create dyspeptic calamities in the magically inclined."

He glances down at the pouch he just stuffed with berries. "But sometimes the terrible stomach pains are worth feeling like a teenager again."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Eb smiles after you eat the fruit and then leaves you to your devices. Not long after a warm, tingling sensation spreads through your body. Your hair stands on end and your skin feels almost electric to the touch. Chills begin to creep from your spine, running along your limbs to the tips of your extremities. The edges of your vision blurs, and your bowels churn.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You secret the berries away. When you next check on them, you find that they've gone slightly off color and mushy. The smell wafting from the fruit reminds you of a corpse. Deciding it might make a worthwhile poison, you bottle the juices. The reeking pulp (and the pouch you stored it in), on the other hand, you discard.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You pass some time with Kills-In-Shadow, rutting behind a rocky hill. The experience is equal parts performance and endurance - a blur of rippling muscles, wet fur, and raked skin. 

Though it takes quite a while to shake the scent of sweat and urine from your pores, the Beastwoman lopes along a little taller as you continue your journey.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The old man laughs pleasantly. "Got into the Budding Rose, I see?" He moves to make a note of this with his quill, then seems to think better of it. "I'll have to decline, dear Binder. I'm flattered but uh... I think I'm too old to keep up with you." He chuckles quietly to himself as he leaves you to your urges.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>When you ask her, Sirin blinks, blanches, and blushes in rapid succession. "What?" she asks, balking. "Ew, Fatebinder! I mean, I'm flattered, sure. But still. Ew! Can we just pretend we never had this conversation? Seriously? Ew!" She hastily retreats.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You spend the next several hours alone, muscles contracting in irregular spasms as your body does everything in its power to purge the berries from your innards. You see the sigils of the Archons - even ones you've never heard of before - in your mind's eye, but they shift and twist, as indistinct as a mirage.

Finally the sickness passes and you make your way back to the road to resume your journey, eager to put this episode behind you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He eyes the offered berries suspiciously. Barik tells you that while he appreciates the gesture, he's had bad experiences in the past eating wild berries of the Tiers. His bronze and iron prison did nothing to decrease the unpleasantness.</DefaultText>

Beastmen eat blood berries, yep, yep, before they hunt, kill, rut. Quickens beating of heart. Raises spear. Not for Beastwoman." She chuffs quietly and returns to her tasks.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Budding Rose, Fatebinder?" Verse asks, eying the berries. "I didn't know you felt that way about me. And here I would have thought you were the type to come right out and ask." She shakes her head. "Either way, I'm afraid I'm going to have to decline. I'm not interested in complications right now, and those are little round, red complications."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Reaching first to her knees then behind her neck, in four motions, Eb's rope harness comes undone. Her garments collapse all at once, and a length of hempen rope runs between her hands. With a burst of speed, she presses into you, her hands threading the rope around your waist.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Once Eb has you tied and fastened to her liking, she stands over you with an impish smile.

You ride out the waves of euphoria with Eb on top of, around, and astride you - her moving about your body as you remained tied in place - 'for your own safety' as she says.

When the rush of the berries at last subsides, Eb unties you slowly, and playfully, before the two of you return to your journey.</DefaultText>
