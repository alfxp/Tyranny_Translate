      <DefaultText>You crest a hill to find the road before you entirely flooded by deep, churning water. One of the nearby rivers must have jumped its banks.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Peering at the churning water, your [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] companion rubs the back of his head. "I'd suggest that I walk along the bottom, were it not for the damnable need to breathe... Apologies, Fatebinder. My presence here may hinder your options."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This time, however, responsibility for the complication lies entirely with humans. The road crosses a river ahead, and someone, likely one of the Tiers' many warring factions, has sabotaged the crossing. The center of the bridge is entirely missing.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The road ahead terminates at the next river, which runs fat with rainwater. You see a few wooden posts leaning in the mud, the remnants of the bridge that once spanned this gully. The bulk of the bridge is nowhere to be seen.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With your rope in place, fording the turbulent water becomes a simple matter of holding tight and crossing carefully. You reach the other side safely and feel focused by your effort.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You press into the water and force your way towards the center. Your footing slips once or twice, but you manage to stay standing. By the time you reach the far shore, you're not sure where the sweating ends and the rainwater begins. Yet the danger and effort focused your wits, and you're ready to continue your journey.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A tree on the far side of the water seems a solid enough anchor to bear weight, so you tie an end of your rope to an arrow and expertly fire it through the rain and wind. Thunder and rainfall swallows the sound of its landing, but the arrow responds to your tug without dislodging. This should make fording the river significantly safer.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Spying a tree to serve as an anchor point, you draw your bow and let an arrow fly. You fail to compensate for the wind, however, and the projectile lands well wide of its mark. You can pull the arrow in by the rope, but further attempts yield similar results. You'll have to find another solution.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>At the foot of the bridge you find a set of discarded tools and planks. They don't seem to belong to the saboteurs - perhaps the locals had set out to repair the bridge before the storm came. Deciding you don't have time to wait out the weather, you take up plank, hammer, and nails and get to work. It doesn't take too long for you to make a workable crossing. It won't hold up a cart, but it's enough to let you continue your journey.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It seems that the saboteurs left the tools of their treachery behind: you find some wood and tools near the foot of the bridge. Collecting the detritus, you rig a few nails and planks into a makeshift span across the gap in the crossing. You walk carefully onto it, and it immediately collapses under you. Your head cracks painfully against the part of the structure still standing, your vision going black as you crash into the wet.

You drag yourself from the far side of the water, having escaped the river with your life and a splitting headache.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A few very large stones standing near the broken remnants of the bridge inspire an idea. Placing flat palms and shoulders against the rock, you slowly push it onto the road and up the bridge. It falls into the gap left by the saboteurs with a tremendous splash. With the stone in place, you easily cross the breach and continue on your journey, quite content with your creative solution.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You think you may be able to move one of the large, nearby boulders into the gap in the bridge, so you set yourself against it and begin to push. Unfortunately you're rewarded only with the furrows your boots gouge into the mud.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You carefully secure your gear, then take a few long breaths, readying yourself for the battle across the surging flow. You dive in, and almost immediately feel weighed down by your belongings, and your chest aches both for air and with the strain. You kick against the current, trying to keep from being pushed too far down the flood. 

After what feels like hours, you pull yourself free at the far side of the water. You sit on the shore, catching your breath, feeling tougher for the experience and ready to continue your travels.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You shoulder your gear, take a deep breath, and throw yourself into the turbulent current. Stronger by far than you expected, it sweeps you along, and you are thrown against a stone jutting from the water. You cling to it, gasping for air, before pushing off of it towards the far side. When you finally pull yourself from the water, you collapse in the riverside reeds to catch your breath.

You survived, and sometimes that's enough.

      <DefaultText>The droplets on your hands harden into tiny crystals as your fingers twist into the mystic gestures of frost. The blueish glow of arcane energy builds around you, and you weave it with sweeping movements into the sigil of a long-dead Archon. With an open palm you channel the magic before you and into the flood, and the water immediately rewards you by slowing and solidifying into a span of solid ice that arches to the far shore.

Though the path is slick, you take it carefully and cross without difficulty, the mystic forces you called upon easing the way and clinging to your being.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Deciding that the safest route is best, you choose not to chance the waters here. You follow the edge of the flood until you come to a series of flat stones several leagues from the road. You gingerly step from one to the next, crossing the river.

By the time you return to the road, you're exhausted, soaked, and several hours behind schedule.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your gear bundled above your head, you wade into the water. You soon find yourself shoulders deep and struggling against the current's push. Your foot slips on something slick, and water fills your nostrils as you plunge into the water. You come up flailing and coughing, and you only barely manage to grasp your gear before it's lost to the flood. It feels like an hour later before you reach the far shore - alive, but with your pride and your leg aching from the struggle.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Clouds hang low over the Tiers, disgorging a deluge of rain, thunder shaking your bones as lightning arcs across the sky. You press on with your journey with the awareness that weather like this often complicates travel...</DefaultText>

      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>You turn to your resident expert on water with an expectant glare. 'Child's play' is how Eb describes the task as she moves her hands in rehearsed, mystical patterns.

Eb steps into the river and pushes out her arms, a ripple of ice surging forward from where she stands at the riverbed. The current lap over the impromptu dam of ice, making the walk across the river a maddening exercise in moving slowly over thin ice while Eb saunters ahead, sure-footed on the wet, icy surface.

When you arrive at last at the far end of the river, Eb's smugness is a small price to pay for the time and effort saved.</DefaultText>
