      <DefaultText>A man walks the road ahead of you, following it in the opposing direction. He approaches openly, hands at his sides and free of weapons, a cloak swaying in time with his light tread. Yet you can tell by his cautious poise that he has been no stranger to violence. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A lanky man sits on a log just off the road, coaxing shade from a stone overhang dripping with desiccated vines. Though his loose cloth garb doesn't necessarily mark him as a [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url], his ink-stained hands and the quills tucked into his hood certainly do. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A woman approaching from the opposing direction stops well before reaching you. She raises a hand in salute, but comes no closer. Her stance displays the easy grace of a veteran of many fights, and she has a long-shafted and massive-headed axe over her right shoulder. Lank raven hair frames her pale features.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A woman waves to you from the road ahead. Even from a distance you can see the sun glinting on the loose coppery rings of her long hair, and her dress seems to be of a quality greater than that available to all save the nobility and wealthiest merchants. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A man steps onto the road ahead of you, a bow slung over his shoulder, rabbits hanging by the feet from his belt. His deeply tanned skin is largely covered in hides and leather armor, small, polished shells hanging from leather tassels and necklaces, each separated from the others by tiny, intricately-tooled pieces of leather to prevent them from clattering together. He raises a hand in greeting, though he initially maintains his distance.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You see the woman and her entourage long before you reach her. She's flying a banner of the Overlord and smaller heraldry marking her as a member of the small, legally-sanctioned Guild of the Prismatic Mists. Her long, colorful robes of rich linen and silk vouch for her membership within the exclusive school of mystic practitioners. She hails you, promising peace in the name of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url].</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As the man nears, you realize that he's wearing nothing save a tattered cape from the waste up and the barest remnants of a skirt otherwise. His coal-black skin carries scars both from old battle wounds and shallowly carved ritualistic sigils. A close crop of tightly curled white hair crowns his head, and a blade of well-tended bronze hangs at his side.

You exchange a greeting with the man, and it becomes quickly apparent that he's a battle mage, an individual of arcane talent raised from an early age to make war with both spell and sword. Recognizing in you an adventurous nature, he offers to teach you some of the finer points of combining blade and sigil in exchange for a bottle of Oldwater.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You realize that the tall man is significantly older than he at first appeared, the lines on his face and spots on his bald pate belying his tall posture and athletic stance. He tells you that he parted way with his former school many years ago and has spent much of his life traveling and in study. "It keeps me young."

The [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] suggests that he would be willing to share some of his former order's arcane lore, preservation magic, and staff-wielding tricks with an individual of your abilities. All he would require in exchange is a pouch of Skycap.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Nearer the woman, you see that her armor is fashioned primarily of thick hide well-reinforced with heavy sheets of bronze. Several scars mar her face and bare arms, and tattoos cover much of the rest. Her nose looks to have had a losing run in with a bladed weapon at some point in the past, the scar descending to twist her upper lip into a permanent sneer. Dark circles lurk beneath her eyes as they probe you.

Voice grim and even, the warrior asks whether you happen to carry any Waking Death on you. She's willing to trade training for it, claiming both offensive and defensive mastery of two-handed weapons.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you approach, the woman's face falls, and she lowers her arm. She bows deeply as she addresses you as Archon, stopping just short of falling to her knees in obeisance. She confesses immediately that she had every intention of spinning to you an entirely untrue yarn about a lost family fortune and a surefire bid to win it back, but she knows you from your reputation as an Archon and Fatebinder before.

Perhaps the two of you can help one another, she notes. She is in need of a rare potion of invisibility. If you could provide her some, she would exchange a few of the tricks she's learned among the liars and dirty fighters of the Tiers.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you approach, the man bows and addresses you by your title. His dark brown hair has more than the beginnings of gray at the temples and his thick mustache droops over plump lips.

He states that as a well-traveled arbiter of the law, you may be in possession of Azurebell petals. He proposes a trade: for an Azurebell flower or the equivalent number of petals, he'll teach you the secrets of archery and javelin throwing he's perfected over his decades hunting the wilds of the Tiers, including how to stay light on your feet to avoid danger. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The woman's hair is carefully twisted into thick gray dreadlocks that frame a kindly, well-wrinkled face the color of toasted pecans. She leans on a staff, though it appears more for ambulation than magic. She explains that she's been tasked by the Adjudicator in making a study of the Bane of the Tiers. 

To that end, she notes, if you have any Bane Essence you would be willing to part with, you would be saving her significant effort and risk. In exchange, she would happily further your understanding of the mystic arts of Frost, Lightning, and Atrophy.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Then let us waste no time. Ready your weapon and your mind." You pass the evening in a relatively quiet combination of sparring with live blades and practicing the sigils of war. By the time you go your separate ways, you are sore in body and mind.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The elder stands and stretches. "Well then, let us begin immediately. Your fingers shall be screaming for mercy before the sigil drills have finished with you." You pass the evening in concentrated study and magical practice. By the time you part with the [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url], you know secrets few others alive possess.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She brings the offered fungus to her nose and inhales deeply, nodding slowly, her shadowed gaze never leaving you. She stores the offering in a small pouch at her side and hefts her weapon. "Ready yourself. This shall be among the longest days of your life."

She's not wrong. By the time the two of you go your separate ways, your arms, legs, and shoulders all ache from the exertion and the sparring blows alike.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As she takes the proffered bottle, her grin brightens the day. She holds it up, examining the light's passage through the liquid. With a flick of her wrist, the bottle vanishes.

"We should get started. I can show you techniques, but the secret's always prolonged and repeated practice." You spend the remainder of the day learning mysteries of misdirection, how to fight when caught without a weapon, and how best to wield against a foe the two small weapons the woman tells you that you should always have hidden on your person.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The hunter holds the flower tenderly, his attention almost wistful, before he carefully secures it in a pouch at his side. He pulls the bow from his shoulder. "I hope you've not got sensitive fingers, Archon. This string'll pass over them more than a few times before sunset." You spend the remaining daylight working with the Tiersman as he teaches you how best to hold a bow and javelin to hit a moving target while staying light enough on your feet to avoid any unexpected dangers. By the time you part ways, your fingertips and the balls of your feet ache with exertion.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The magician's eyes glimmer in the pale glow emanating from the bag of essence. "Incredible. This sample displays a particularly resonant weft." She reluctantly closes the bag and hands it to one of her followers for safe keeping. 

She cracks slightly arthritic fingers. "Let us knuckle down while daylight remains to us. The sigils of the Archons do not reveal their myriad secrets to a brushing glance." You spend the remainder of the day and no small part of the night in practice of mystical forms with the mage. By the time you part ways, the joints of your fingers feel like they have been dislocated and reset in a form more in keeping with the Archons' many and contradictory insights.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well met, Archon." The elder mage formerly of the School of Ink and Quill greets you with a bow. "I suppose that this meeting is mere coincidence? Is it too much to hope that you have come to ply me with Skycap in exchange for the ancient and arcane secrets of those who walked the Archon's path before you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>At your approach, the pale-skinned warrior nods almost imperceptibly in greeting. "If you have Waking Death," she says, "I can offer you the best sparring practice you've had in years. Otherwise, I doubt we have any business."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The willowy traveler smiles cordially at your approach. "Archon! Is there ever a fairer day than one in which our paths cross?" She bows low, copper-colored hair briefly brushing the dirt of the road. "Perhaps you've come to exchange a bottle of invisibility potion for a few words of advice in the more subtle arts of word and knife play."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The woman bows her head at your approach, her hair falling in thick, gray dreadlocks around her wizened features. "Archon, it is my honor to meet you again on the road. Have you perhaps collected any Bane Essence in your journeys? I will happily exchange lessons in the arcane arts of Frost, Lightning, and Atrophy for a sample."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The master mage nods, bowing again. "Of course, Archon. I cannot ask you to perform my duties for me. I shall continue my journeys, and perhaps our paths will again align." She leaves you to your travels.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The old man grins, twisting the long scar that runs below his rheumy white left eye. "For drinking," he answers, voice gruff. "You face the Bane as often as I do, and a vial of Oldwater can determine the difference between seeing another sunrise and an agonizing death in the shadow of the Oldwalls."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The old mage releases a prolonged sigh, then lightly taps on his temple. "Age makes fools of us all, I'm afraid. Well, perhaps not Archons such as yourself." He chuckles quietly. "Us mere mortals, though, we find that our memories fail us and our thoughts flee us in our dotage. A pinch of Skycap sharpens the wits. Almost makes me feel young again."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She regards you in silence for nearly half a minute before tendering an answer. "I've had a standing appointment with the void for no few years." Her tone is as dark and sharp as a shard of obsidian as she indicates her scarred visage with a simple gesture. "I intend to keep it waiting."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As warm and clear as sunlight, her laughter could set a frenzied Beastman at ease. "A plot, of course! A ploy of questionable legality. I could hardly make of you an accomplice by divulging its cunning details."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The flower's becoming a rarity," he answers sadly, "ever since [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] made of Azure a wasteland. I'm collecting them for an alchemist I know to preserve the juices. Nothing quite like it in a pinch to keep you on your toes, sharpen your aim." He pats the rabbits dangling at his side. "Hardly need it against the long-ears, but you know as well as me they ain't the only creatures making a home of the wilds."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Because the Adjudicator wills it, of course." Her head tilts to the right. "The remnant essence of the Bane allows for detailed examination of the numinous resonance of their liminal weft." She smiles apologetically. 

"By which I mean the composite energetic processes that allow the Bane to simultaneously present material and ephemeral forms, the very properties that have convinced people with less respect for their internal organs than us to consume the essence in an attempt to ward off magic." She chuckles.</DefaultText>
