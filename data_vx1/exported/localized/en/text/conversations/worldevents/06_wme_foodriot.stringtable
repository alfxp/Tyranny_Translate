      <DefaultText>As you near a settlement a few hours outside the walls of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s capital, you hear a clamoring of voices raised in frustration. The village is little more than a dilapitated public house, a few farms, and a small central square thronged with an incensed crowd.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You storm into the square, and knock around the loudest and most aggressive peasants, shoving to the muddy ground anyone who dares step up to you. Joining the magistrate on his platform, you order the farmers to disband this assembly and return to their work. One of them raises his voice in complaint and you break his kneecap with a quick kick, sending him sprawling.

As the crowd loses cohesion, you give the magistrate an unimpressed glance before making your way from the village. The road stretches before you towards the remainder of your journey.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You stride to the center of the square, shoving aside those who hinder your procession. With a resounding shout you quiet the peasantry to a low, bristling hum. You turn on the magistrate and ask what is happening in this village.

"They've taken our food!" shouts one of the farmers. "That's what happened. Taken it for their endless war. How are we supposed to feed our children, ourselves?" You silence the farmer with a curt glare as the magistrate confirms the complaints.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"After the trade caravans were ransacked during the war, food became scarce," the magistrate interjects. "A few local gangs, unable to afford rations in the city, tried to buy goods here. What the farmers wouldn't sell, the Chorusmen stole. I tried to explain that it's for the Overlord's conquest. That the people have no one to blame but criminals such as the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] and the [url=glossary:vendrien guard]Vendrien Guard[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What's the point?" one farmer replies. "Anything we plow, anything we hunt, we might as well just be handing it over to the Chorus!" He gestures recklessly at the magistrate. "[url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s flacid gavel here hasn't done a damn thing to save this town! What does the Adjudicator expect of us? To eat stone and air?"

"The gangs have flocked through here for years!" another farmer objects. "They're like a chrysalis cloud alighting to clear the fields and then on their way again!"</DefaultText>

"I assure you, good Binder," the magistrate affirms, "that despite their current less-than-enthusiastic state, the people of this village are loyal members of the Overlord's empire."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Adopting the authoritarian tone and gestures you learned in the rigid hierarchy of war, you order the farmers back to work. Most comply immediately, and only a handful require sterner physical encouragement.

With the peasants dispersed, you turn your attention to the magistrate's guards. You shout them down, demanding they learn to keep order under their watch lest they require a second visit from [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s Fatebinder.

You leave the settlement a calmer, quieter place.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You draft a missive to the Court of the Adjudicator in the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url] requesting additional defenders for the settlement to protect it from Chorus depredation. 

You continue on your journey, trusting in the Archon of Justice to reinforce the village's defenses. Sure enough, a return missive finds you on the road, assuring you that the town will be seen to, but expressing disappointment in your inability to handle the situation without requesting the Court's aid.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If you insist, Fatebinder." The Archon of Song hums quietly at first, drawing the attention of all present. As she purses her lips, the gem in her headdress catches the light of the sun. Her voice rises, seemingly filling the air from every direction, somehow sustaining multiple notes at the same time.

She unclasps her hands, gently raising them, then lowering them, and those gathered nod, eyes following the subtle movements of her fingers. Narrowed eyes calm, clenched fists open, and anger seeps from tense shoulders. Features placid, the villagers disperse towards their individual homesteads.

Sirin brings her song to a close, gives a slight curtsey, and grins. You nod to her and you continue your journey, leaving this settlement behind you, another testament to the persuasiveness of the Archon of Song.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Verse shrugs but acquiesces, and you spend an evening hunting down the offending gang. Verse easily bests their leader in brutal fisticuffs and demands the gang leaves the Bastard Tier for the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url]. 

"Proud of yourselves?" she growls at the Chorusmen while sitting on their leader's back, her hand in his hair, holding his face in the mud. "Think scaring farmers and stuffing your fat faces brings glory to [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url]? Make yourselves fucking useful already! Go kill some Beastmen or something." She lets the gang leader's head up and he swallows air in deep, sucking gasps.

Confident that the attacks on the Bastard Tier will abate, you continue your journey towards your destination. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You tell the assembly to break up and return to their farms, a shouted order that is met with shouts in return. Gaining no traction with words, you storm into the crowd, shoving peasants to the muck, kicking legs out from under them, breaking noses with thrown elbows. The peasants scatter in the face of your abrupt aggression, fleeing the square for the safety of their homesteads.

With a final glare at the magistrated, you move on, leaving the town simmering behind you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Beastwoman's lip curls back in an expression you only half-suspect is a grin. She leaps into the assembly with a roar, cuffing any peasant in reach and sending them sprawling. Villagers flee the square in terror as Kills-In-Shadow grasps the broad-shouldered farmer and forces him to the ground. You hold his gaze as she marks him with her scent. He closes his eyes in shame, utterly cowed.

As the Shadowhunter steps off of the man, you look to the magistrate, your glare an unspoken threat to do the same to him if this settlement requires your attention again. You take the road from the square, the Beastwoman loping along beside you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>In a tersely-worded missive, you blame the Archon of Secrets and his army for the troubles in the village. You demand that he make recompense and provide the villagers with food from the Chorus stores.

You send the missive and continue on your journey.

Later you receive a response from [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] praising at length your concern for the common Tiersman. His adulation is so effusive and extravagant that you quickly identify it as sarcastic. The Archon promises to provide the village with some of the Chorus' finest spoils, a promise that fills you with little confidence.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You dash off a missive reporting the squad of Chorusmen to [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url], assuming that they should be somewhere they can actually fight the enemies of the Archon rather than in the Bastard Tier bedeviling conquered peasants. 

You continue on your journey, and shortly thereafter you receive a response from the leader of the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url]. Voices of Nerat compliments your attention to detail and thanks you - excessively, you think, possibly to the point of sarcasm - for helping him find his mislocated hordesmen. He promises that they'll be rounded up and strung up for the buzzards for their lack of creativity and discretion.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>In a formal missive, you demand that the Archon of Secrets remove his active troops from the conquered Bastard Tier, recognized territory of the Archon of Justice, lest they be rounded up and executed for dereliction of duty and their general fined for failure to retain command of his troops.

After sending the missive, you continue your journey. Not long after, a response comes from Cacophony. [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]The Voices of Nerat[/url] promises to rein in his errant hordesmen and effusively praises the neverending dedication of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s Fatebinders to the blind execution of the Overlord's Law.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You reach out to your ally in a missive, informing him of the gang roving the Bastard Tier and requesting that he relocate them to somewhere they can be more useful.

You continue on your journey, and [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url]'s response comes more quickly than you would have expected. He tells you that he's sent the offending gang into the [url=glossary:blade grave]Blade Grave[/url], sure that the bellies they've filled on the spoils of their raids should serve them well in the sparsely vegetated remnants of Stalwart.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You grab the magistrate by the collar and shake him roughly. His bodyguards hold their positions when you fix them with a baleful glare. 

"You let your people starve?" you ask, contempt thick on your voice. "That wasn't what the Adjudicator had in mind when he appointed you."

Blood drains from the man's round cheeks as he stammers a response: "Of, of course not, Binder! But if food doesn't exist - not that the fields lie fallow - and when it does it's taken, that doesn't leave... it's not like I'm taking it! I go hungry as well."</DefaultText>
