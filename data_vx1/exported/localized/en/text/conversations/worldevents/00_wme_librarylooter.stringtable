      <DefaultText>A full-figured woman in a grime smudged smock beckons to you as your paths cross near the ruins of a nameless town in the crack stones of old Azure. She waves excitedly, almost bouncing from foot to foot. "You," she cries out, "look like a traveler of MEANS!" Her voice echoes down the abyssal crevasse between you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You pass without much interaction, brushing aside her attempts to converse. As you walk away, she continues in the opposite direction, gaze downcast.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You immediately inform her that she's in violation of the Overlord's provisions against the possession of forbidden knowledge. She begins to stammer an excuse, but you see her fingers forming practiced sigils.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You lash out at her before she has an opportunity to finish her spell. The first blow ruins her hands, and she screams, holding the mangled appendages to her chest. Your second strike ends her life. 

You rifle through her robes, discovering a small bundle of parchment. It's possible the magician had more cached away nearby, but if there's any truth to that supposition, it died with her.</DefaultText>
