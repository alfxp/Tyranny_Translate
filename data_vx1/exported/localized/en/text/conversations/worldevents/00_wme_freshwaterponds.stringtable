      <DefaultText>Off the road ahead of you see a broad, placid lake fed by a river flowing from the north. A handful of fishing boats dot the surface, and the songs of amphibians linger on the cool breeze. A small pack of [url=glossary:flightless]flightless[/url] birds wade in the shallows, plucking crayfish from the muck.

It seems a perfect place to fill your waterskins and take a rest.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>While lowering yourself along a seemingly endless rope perilously anchored in a stone that juts out over a much lower stone flat, you make out the gurgling of slowly-moving water. As your descent continues, the stone wall falls away from you into a massive cavern containing a thin sliver of stream winding away from a timid waterfall. It gathers in a large basin filled with thick mud warmed by the sunlight from above. Damp moss clings to the rocks, and vines crawl the inner stones of the overhang before dangling above you like verdant constellations. 

You reach solid ground and determine this a reasonable locale to rest your aching muscles.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Nestled among the trenches gouged across the [url=glossary:blade grave]Blade Grave[/url] by the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Storms you find a true rarity: a sheltered pool of water. Seemingly fed by a spring, the pool gives way to a pair of thin streams that become choked with grit and rust almost immediately after they snake out from under the shelter of a towering curled sheet of twisted bronze armor. 

Skeletal arms, held together by bunched strands of dried tendon, hang from the roof of the unnatural cavern, and a half-broken statue, a pitted graven image of an ancient Stalwart queen, protrudes from the wet, suggesting that this may once have been the center of a settlement.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Amidst a copse of blackened trunks you find a stretch of cloudy water. Faint tendrils of steam rise from the surface in slender curls. Thin brown grass grows almost to the water's edge before giving way to bare gray stone dusted with a thin layer of soot. A scent of brimstone hangs in the warm, stagnant air, joined by something else - the faintest vibration of a power just beyond your human perception.

The water seems to issue from a small cavern set into a hillock a hundred yards north.</DefaultText>

During your training in the pit, you used to chase [url=glossary:flightless]flightless[/url]; if you couldn't catch a [url=glossary:flightless]flightless[/url], you wouldn't be able to catch an opponent off guard.

You charge headlong into the group fishing in the shallows, hands snapping outwards with blinding speed to grasp the neck of two of the birds. A quick flick of each wrist wrenches the beasts' necks to the point of snapping, and you return to the shore with your haul. You pluck one of the creatures and roast it over an open flame, providing a hearty, albeit bland, dinner. The other you save for the road.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You set down your gear on a broad, flat rock near the pool, break bread, and replenish your water from the falls. It's cool and crisp, a welcome change from the leather aftertaste of your waterskin. Afterward, you strip down and lower yourself into the warm mud. It draws the soreness from your back and shoulders and massages your sun-worn skin. By the time you climb out, you feel like a new person, almost as if the mud of the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url] has formed a new layer of flesh above your sinew.  

You dress and shoulder your gear, ready to move on to the next locale.</DefaultText>

Kneeling by the water, you replenish your skins before splashing your face with the cool moisture. You try to wipe as much of the grime and grit from yourself as possible, almost impressed by how much of it hides in the folds of your face and the cracks in your hands.

Afterward you lay out on your bedroll, enjoying the shelter the grotto offers against the elements as you drift into unconsciousness.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You strip off your soot-stained garments before gingerly stepping into the warm water. You wade out into the pool, then lower yourself into its heat. It seems to settle into your pores and meander along your tendons, settling into your joints. As sweat beads across your brow, your muscles perceptibly relax, stiffness fleeing into the wet. 

Taking up a spare scrap of cloth, you wipe yourself clean of the dust and grime of the road, starting with the oil of your face and finishing with the muck that has settled between your toes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The stream from the pool winds among dull brown stones before streaming over the edge and into the darkness of a depthless crevasse.

At the lip of the cliff you find a few pictographs carved into the stone: a man and a woman, holding hands, with a beast cub between them. A sun shines down upon them, and they bask in it at the water's shore, represented by a trio of long squiggles.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You recognize the canines as extremely poorly-kempt cousins of the hunting dogs common among the kennels of the aristocracy in [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' dominion. Your family bred and trained such animals not merely to help track game, but to hunt down criminals and agitators who dared flaunt the Overlord's authority.

You move calmly towards the dogs, standing confidently with raised hands, and address them in a tone both even and firm, a voice that brooks no disobedience, but instead bends to your noble will animals and commoners alike.</DefaultText>

Using all of your energy you manage to force them back and get some distance between yourself and the pack. 

Breathing heavily, you leave this pond behind. No water is worth those mongrels' gnashing maws.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Hoping to set camp, secure refreshments, and maybe even bathe, you move towards a promisingly flat stone near the water - only to find the dogs leaping and biting at you. You back away, and the dogs continue to growl at you, glaring from above saliva-dripping jaws and browning teeth.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You manage to take down one of the deer, sending the others fleeing into the wilderness, but the bloodied, struggling beast attracts the immediate attention of the pack of dogs, who fall voraciously upon it. Attempts to intervene in the feeding frenzy earn you snapping fangs and low growls. You eventually scatter the mutts, but by that point little is left of the deer save bloody bones and ragged bowels.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With practiced expertise you down a deer, skin and clean it, and slice off the choicest bits of venison to roast over the fire. The remainder of the meats you prepare for travel, and the hide you flesh, wash and dry.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The lake cave creatures - pale fish with bioluminescent organs above their eyes and overlapping carapace plates - cook easily enough, though their rubbery texture seems an acquired taste. You find that their luminous bulbs can be saved, however, and may be useful in alchemical compounds.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Their desperation lends the dogs a feral strength, and even as you move among them they surround you, their claws and teeth finding the gaps in your apparel and sinking into your skin and muscle. Using all of your energy you manage to force them back and get some distance between yourself and the pack. 

Breathing heavily, you leave this pond behind. No water is worth those mongrels' gnashing maws.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Stripping down to your smallclothes, you slip into the warm water and make your way into the darkness of the cave. Once within, your eyes quickly adjust to the gloom, and you find a small chamber of stone before the tunnel dips lower, deep into the water and inaccessible.

The chamber itself is comfortable, the light from without slipping in across the surface of the water, dappling the cracked roof with caustic patterns. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>By the time you finish, perhaps due to some quality of the water, you feel more clean and calm than you have in your entire life. Even the baths at [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s Court did not compare to this natural wonder.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The natural enclosure sweeping high above the grotto has protected the painted marble statue from the worst of the destruction of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Storms. Draped in a dress painted pale crimson, the queen's skin is a deep bronze, and what's left of her tightly curled hair is rendered in enameled black, giving the impression that it has been well-oiled. Her right hand raises a broken spear, and her left a downturned dagger.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The oldest stories make you wonder, though, and you investigate the statue carefully, fingers prodding its curves and contours before locating a small hidden compartment in the statue's heel. Within you find a small, glimmering trinket. You pocket it and continue on your way.</DefaultText>
