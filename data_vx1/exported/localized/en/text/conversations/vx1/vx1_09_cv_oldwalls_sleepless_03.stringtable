      <DefaultText>A bedraggled-looking man shivers near the edge of the overlook, clothes damp and stained with an inky-black substance. He moans softly to himself and occasionally mutters a few words in a low, incomprehensible tone.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You prod him with your finger - first, gently, then insistently. His skin is unusually cold to the touch. Despite your persistence, you elicit little more than a grunt from the man. He shifts slightly and you notice a strap wrapped around one of his legs, extending over the nearby ledge.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He attempts to straighten his back, but it's unclear if the action is in response to the sound of your voice. The effort is too great - he hunches again, using his arms to help brace himself against the floor.  As his head sags forward, he continues to emit a low moan.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The man only trembles further in response. His dried and cracked hands paw at the ground around him, a sluggish and futile search of some sort. His soft grunts increasingly grow frustrated. After a few moments, he very suddenly abandons the hunt - with head bent low and half-closed eyes, he resumes his quiet wail.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Peering over the edge, you notice a half-open satchel attached to the strap, dangling precariously above the ground. Within it, you spot the sharp features and the persistent, soft glow of an Oldwalls torchkey.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>In one smooth motion, you lift the crystal from the satchel and hide it from sight within the folds of your pack. With no light to draw his attention, the agitated man relaxes and returns to his foggy somnambulance.</DefaultText>

      <ID>13</ID>
      <DefaultText>You carefully pull the satchel upward, preventing it from twisting unexpectedly. The dazed man beside you mumbles softly to himself. As you reach into the bag and pull the torchkey out, his eyes catch sight of its glow. Between labored breaths, he manages a painful croak. "Light... my light..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The befuddled man scarcely reacts as you slide the knife into his chest. He stares at the wound, momentarily confused, before releasing a sharp, pained breath and slumping to the floor.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Rocking back and forth, the exhausted husk of a man fails to notice your presence.</DefaultText>
