      <DefaultText>A man clad in the frayed remnants of his Earthshaker uniform focuses intently upon dark stones held in cupped hands. His eyes move from one piece to the next. He hears your footsteps and shifts his gaze to meet yours. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I find myself at home here, even if everything about the Oldwalls seems antithetical to life. If the Bane don't kill you, the water will - without Jaspos, this place couldn't exist." His eyes move from the churning water to the massive stone walls stretching towards the sky. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The color drains from Argaen's face. He raises a quivering hand in a defensive posture, ready to trace an arcane sigil. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I will NOT leave Jaspos. My life with him is the only good thing I've built in all of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' wretched empire." He raises his downturned head and locks eyes with you. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I could..." Argaen glances at the dirt path trailing away from the remnants of Rostrom Manor. He takes a breath and plants a foot firmly into the ground.</DefaultText>

      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I swore I'd protect him and... never thought that meant leaving him but... I never expected any of the nonsense that's happened in the last year. Fine... I'll go. If I find out you harmed Jaspos anyway, I'll find you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText> As he begins to gasp in pain, you take hold of the weapon's hilt and place the heel of your boot against his torso, pushing off of him in one smooth motion. The Earthshaker flies over the cliff's edge, tumbling towards a final rest amongst the rocks below.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Oldwalls have always been invigorating spaces for mages of my ilk. They're like untapped fonts of magical energy. And the ancient masonry? Inspiring. What was life like to the people that shaped these massive walls?" He shrugs, amused.</DefaultText>

      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder! Forgive me, I didn't see you. Jaspos has me performing these exercises to attune my senses, to see the shapes hidden within the rock." Flustered, he quickly tugs on the hem of his shirt and straightens his belt.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"After [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] had been... declared a criminal, [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] charged us with scouring the Archon's belongings and retracing his path.

      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Of course, any association to [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] didn't make me popular with the Legion. Telesophia was all too eager to remind me that if [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]'s treachery were ever to come to light, all Earthshakers would likely be executed for assumed collusion."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He is teaching me to connect with stone in a deeply personal way. Earthshakers manipulate rock, but we don't feel or shape them with the intimacy of the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Been awhile since I could step foot outside. Thanks for clearing out the Chorus goons occupying these ruins. Now, what did you need to discuss, Fatebinder?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That woman's need for vengeance is a POISON. She'd kill me even if it meant using you like a puppet!" Argaen looks at you with mounting panic.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'll not accept my death like some meek Choirman slave. I've been well-trained by the Guild and the Legion. If I'm to die, I'll make sure you bleed in the process!"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But I won't. I'll be damned if I turn my back on Jaspos and the Wound after they took me in!" Without waiting for you to respond, Argaen traces his arms through the air, shaping an elaborate sigil.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Nodding with confirmation, Argaen presses his temples and takes a long and thoughtful silence for himself. </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That is... much for me to consider." He inhales sharply, pondering your words for a frown. "Perhaps it's best that I... resume my sojourn to follow [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] and leave the Wound for a time. If Jaspos does sincerely need my help to run this place, he can find me."</DefaultText>

      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Oh I doubt it. [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] is many great things, but we did not revere him for his foresight. Though... there was that one time [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] accidentally unearthed an iron vein and we told the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] it was entirely planned."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He is still watching you expectantly as the knife enters his chest. Then his eyes snap open wider, and Argaen stares down, slow to register the wound he's taken.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He begins to make his way down the cliff side, pausing to look back at you every few paces. Before long is out of sight.</DefaultText>

      <ID>67</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Wait... so the Guild has thrown off the mantle of [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url]?" His eyes widen with surprise. "That is... most excellent news! The Great General is wise, but he does not truly understand our ways - to him, we are but human siege weaponry."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He bows to you in a low, gracious dip. "You do us a great honor, Fatebinder. I'm sure this means my brethren are at odds with the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] but... such change can only be good in the long run. Better we serve the Court, as the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] do."</DefaultText>
