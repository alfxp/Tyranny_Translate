      <DefaultText>A young man squints at the bottles in front of him. He picks them up, shakes them and sets them down, dissatisfied after every examination. "Was it fennel pollen? Or Rhubarb root? Hmm..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No qualms here. I was a bit nervous having them in town, at first. You have to understand - we fared better than most during the Conquest. [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' war raged on elsewhere, so none of his armies marched through South Haven. But who knew if the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] would attract attention from the Archons, or Brotherhood raiders."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I've no issue with her. Truth be told, I've never really spoken to her. You can hear her barking orders at her apprentices at all hours of the day. I never felt comfortable interrupting their sessions, though I know some folks like Capteron help them out from time to time. Perhaps you should ask him?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Capteron's been in South Haven for a long time. Everyone knows him. He's a... simple man, but about as good-hearted as they come. My father grew up with him right here, said he's always been kind. Capteron doesn't have a trade to speak of, other than helping others."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They proved me wrong! Nobody attacked the village after they arrived. When Cassandra isn't training them, the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] help us out however they can. Can't say I'm a fan of the curfew they enforce, but it's a fair trade for their services."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He'd probably go out to pick herbs for me if I ask him! He likes to stay near the village entrance to direct travelers most of the time. Since he's always assisting folks and the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url], he's one of the few that are allowed to wander about during evening curfew."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He glances at the merchant's stall and shakes his head. "I'm sorry, I don't have the time. My wife's ill and I need to get something for her. Wouldn't be right to blather on with strangers while she tosses in bed."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My wife took fever recently, burning temples and an awful rash. She's a tough one, but I wanted to get her some medicine. I know that boiled Silverthorn works well, but that's a few rings too many for me. There must be an alternate.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Elderbark is what you want. Almost as potent as Silverthorn but a lot more plentiful - you can probably buy it for a song."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh... thank you! That's very kind of you. I'm quite worried about my wife and these herbs will really help. Is there anything I can help you with? It's the least I can do."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ah, Cassandra demanded it. I guess the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] dealt with raiders on their journey here and don't ever want to be caught unawares again. It's a hassle but... I'd rather them here - not like I need to be wandering around in the dark anyway."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So aside from a few folks, most of us stay indoors come the evening. Cassandra's apprentices then keep an eye out for intruders... after a full day's work, too. Theirs is not an easy trade!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He glances at the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] workers with a knowing smile. "Of course, everyone knows that he's smitten by their leader. He finds every excuse to be close to the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url], and every excuse to avoid speaking with Cassandra. He's an old man with a child's heart."</DefaultText>
