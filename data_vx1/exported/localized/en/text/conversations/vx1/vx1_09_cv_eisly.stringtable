      <DefaultText>With a despondent sigh, the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] smith unfastens the strap around one of her pauldrons and drops the metal appendage to the floor, exposing a muscular figure. She quickly traces a sigil with her ungloved hand and touches a hammer dangling from her smock, frowning as it stubbornly remains inert and unsympathetic to her magical entreaties. 

She glances up as you approach.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Though she looked directly at you a moment earlier, the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url]'s gaze now appears unfocused and soft, fixated upon nothing in particular. Your footsteps break her silent reverie - she returns to the present with a quick shake of the head. "Oh, Fatebinder... sorry, I'm easily distracted these days, it seems."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I do. Jaspos introduced me to knapping, and it came easier than pottery, my first craft."

"If we hadn't fallen in love and married, I might have returned to the North and stayed in [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' good graces." She slowly nods, as if recalling a long-forgotten memory.</DefaultText>

Not every task needs a workbench so, I take my chert, I take my grit, I go for a stroll, I see Insipid Moniker. If it were just one night I see her do this... but..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I... think I am. Started when I broke my hand under the mallet. Rookie mistake. I asked Reef-Talon to heal it, but things have gone sour ever since. 

"Can't sleep, can't summon a sigil to save my life. Worst of all, my..." She lowers her hand down to her stomach, frowning as she thinks better of saying more.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I heard Wagstaff is teaching her magic but, no way she could... well not by herself." Eisly cups her chin pensively. "Fire makes me think Blood Chanters - maybe she 'liberated' something from an old Chorus rival? Or she figured out a way to control an Oldwalls trap but to my limited knowledge, those traps don't use fire but some... other, sort of arcane energy."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If you're short on ideas, you could always speak with the prisoner, Telesophia.

      <DefaultText>The apprentice absorbs your words in silence. "Truly? That is, dreadful news, I would not wish that sort of fate even on an ill-tempered gull like Insipid. Her work is dangerous, perhaps she asked Reef-Talon for healing at some point. She'll get herself killed but, if she can't sleep she'll die soon anyway so..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She speaks hesitatingly, uncomfortable with your reticence. "What could warrant such secrecy? Is anyone in danger?

      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>She stammers softly to herself, unable to gather her thoughts. "F-forgive me. I was wrong to question you. It's not up to me to understand a Fatebinder's judgment, only to accept it. I won't bother you about this again." She delivers a shaky bow and abruptly turns away.</DefaultText>

Eisly's face twists into a scowl, "I would rather the others live in ignorance for as long as I can muster it.

      <DefaultText>"Thank you, Fatebinder. I can't believe one of our own would do this, even one as depraved as Insipid Moniker. And to think I almost didn't mention this to you..." She smiles, visibly relieved by the turn of events. "I've troubled you enough. Thank you again."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A horrible end. Tortured and then left to rage and die in bewilderment. Tiersmen have certainly been reduced to worse... another way that we and the Woundkin are more alike than different." She sighs. "I'm glad it's over. Thanks to you, no more will face such cruelty. You have my gratitude, Fatebinder."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The apprentice steps away from you, hand hovering near a large hammer at her waist. "You sound as twisted as the woman you just killed. Is that all this was to you, an excuse to end more lives?" She relaxes her arm and turns away from you. "I won't speak a word of this Fatebinder... nor will I speak to you ever again."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>She nods, reluctantly. "I wasn't there. I'm sure you did what you thought best. Being held and drained of your vitals - I can imagine that being too much for most, even those as hardy as Beastmen. I've heard tales of tribes rejecting their own members when near-death. I think Beastmen see lingering on in weakness as a travesty." Eisly looks perturbed by that thought. "That's neither here nor there. Thank you, Fatebinder. You've done a good thing."</DefaultText>

Across the way, her husband bends over a large mortar, grinding its contents into fine powder. Eisly watches him with dread in her eyes. "I wish I never asked for your help, Fatebinder.

Eisly's eyes rove your face for answers, her breath coming in shallow heaves. With no assurances to be found, her shoulders sag in defeat.
