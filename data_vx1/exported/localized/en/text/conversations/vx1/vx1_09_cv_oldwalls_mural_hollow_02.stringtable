      <DefaultText>As you approach the wall, what at first appeared to be a collection of haphazard stains seems, on closer inspection, a deliberate creation. A procession of hand prints, all of them too large to be human but about the right size to those of Beasts, festoon the wall, though each is varied in its shape and features.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The prints are all of a similar style - a single-color mark of palm and splayed fingers. There is considerable variety in the exact shapes and sizes of hand prints displayed.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It soon becomes clear that nearly every print is distinguished from one another, some greatly so. Some prints sport bulbous palms, others rectangular, some fingers appear long and clawed, others stunted, a few even show signs of webbing between digits, or joints that bend at odd angles.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That's a disturbing read of it, though I fear you might be right. Maybe the hands burnt into the wall were done by 'Bane-touched' Beasts?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Fingers outstretched, Kills-in-Shadow places her right, then left hands atop the various prints, never finding a match to her own. After sizing her hand against a dozen others, she steps away from the mural, and hunkers to her haunches in silence.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The other style appears to be more an act of heat branding than paint layered on stone. These charcoal-black handprints are slightly recessed, as if the stone had melted from the imprinter's touch. From the corner of your eye, these prints seem to shimmer with the reds and blues of the Bane, but on direct observation, the prints always have a matte black finish.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You examine the prints individually, tracing your finger along the wall's surface to detect any noteworthy changes in texture. After a few moments, you determine that there are two distinct types of print. The first appear to be made with some sort of dark pigment that flakes off at the touch. Many of these pigment-painted prints have faded, some to where only the palm is visible.</DefaultText>
