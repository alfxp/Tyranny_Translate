      <DefaultText>"Howdy, Fatebinder. To be honest, I didn't expect a courtly type like you to show up in this piss hole. Would have thought you'd have better things to do than check up on a few wilting greens growing in Beast shit."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, used to have patrol out in the ruins, keeping the entry free of any unwanted visitors with Hill-Strider and her crew. About a year ago, though, my damn fool husband didn't pull out in time, and the Wound found itself another mouth to feed."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Wagstaff's no idiot. He gave me something that makes the ensorcelled water look like that filthy [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] water.

      <DefaultText>Her face falls. "Fuck me." She shakes her head. "Alright, you've got me over a barrel, Fatebinder. What now? You tell Tycho and she's like as not to gut me.

      <DefaultText>"Tycho's got me on vegetable duty, which suits me just fine. Don't know if it's some post-pregnancy bullshit or something, but those creepy glowing mushrooms make me want to lose my lunch AND dinner." She glances towards Tycho.

      <DefaultText>She lowers her voice. "Look, the survival of the Wound's my top priority. The Wound, and my son.
