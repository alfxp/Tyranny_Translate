      <DefaultText>The spray from the nearby waterfall blankets the overlook with a chill mist. Perched high above the settlement, a sizable crowd of Wagstaff and Jaspos loyalists have gathered in support of their chosen leader. The young scribe separates the two obstinate halves with frequent, but ineffective, entreaties. "Calm yourselves. We're here to settle a delicate matter - an impulsive wrong move shatters everything we've built in this place."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The old Tidecaster angrily raps the damp floor with his staff. "You're witnessing a rare moment. I agree with our vainglorious Master of Bragging on one thing. Reef-Talon's time has come and gone. She deserves a merciful death, her service to our community has earned her no less. Her death will save countless lives, and redeem this... mother-of-Sleepless... of her shame."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well if you'll not voice the concerns that matter, then I will! The current trajectory of this settlement is disastrous and needs to change. Jaspos will have us expand faster, but why? And to what end? We need to slow down and move carefully. Build only what we must, send out only whom we must, and delve only where we must."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Jaspos will fill your head about some glorious future for the Wound. I won't.

      <DefaultText>The Tidecaster cocks an eyebrow. "You're full of surprises, Fatebinder. I took your absolute disinterest in cooperation as a clear-enough sign.

      <DefaultText>The Tidecaster's face tightens into an unending series of disapproving wrinkles, creases and frowns. "Are we really going to do this?" He sighs. "Fine. Everyone here knows me. I've been here since the Wound was little more than a band of frightened children, afraid of this new home of ours."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Beastwoman steps forward hesitatingly. "Is Fatebinder certain? Many human kith do not accept Reef-Talon as [url=glossary:prima]Prima[/url]. Wagstaff and Jaspos do not accept. Beastwoman only wants to help Wound tribe. Does not desire fighting amongst pack mates."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She stares down her rivals with a menacing glare. "Blood feud between ocean mystic and stone smasher has grown into endless poison. Reef-Talon will again hold squabbling humans down until silent, like unruly cubs." The Beastwoman rises to her full height. "Reef-Talon is [url=glossary:prima]Prima[/url] of Wound tribe!

"[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]... help us all." The crowd slowly breaks apart, returning to the settlement with nervous talk of the events that just unfolded. Soon, the crumbling overlook is bereft of commotion, and the tranquil sound of waterfalls fill the area.</DefaultText>
