      <DefaultText>"What? No! It was four days ago. Eight? That's absurd!" Arguing with a perceived interlocutor or perhaps herself, the old [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] mutters with her attention jumping from left hand to right as she banters. "Then we should retrace our steps."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her eyes half-shut, her mouth seemingly frozen in an effortless smile, the [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] looks at you with an expectant stare as she shuffles her weight from one foot to the next, struggling to stay upright.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That voice..." Lexeme looks around, her glance darting in every direction but Lantry's. "Mell, what happened to you? How long has it been? Your youth - where did it go? You're supposed to outlive me, not the other way 'round!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Think back to the Citadel... study nights... that time we found those berries? Do I have to-?"

Clearing his throat, Lantry steps in close to Lexeme and places his hand on her hip and gently kisses her forehead. "Certainly that must spark something?" He steps back, trembling, though she seems unmoved by the experience.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh! Oh my! I had given up hope and almost forgotten I had even sent word!" A look of recollection spreads across her face, and Lexeme examines you head to toe.

      <DefaultText>The old [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url]'s face puckers, and her gaze falls to her feet. "Mell? Where did you place my quills?

Our histories show the Tiersmen growing in hubris, unable to see the doom of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] to the north.
