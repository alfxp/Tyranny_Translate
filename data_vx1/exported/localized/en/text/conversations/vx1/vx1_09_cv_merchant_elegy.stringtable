      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder," the woman before the cart greets you evenly. She wears her graying hair pulled back high over fouled leathers, her narrow eyes emphasizing the dirty creases above her cheeks. "There's not a lot of trade in the Wound, and little of that in magical goods."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Not a bad little place to carve out a bit of life. Better than the war topside, anyway. Wagstaff started things, and he's been a capable hand on the rudder, if that makes sense. Real father-like, as if he's got a stake in it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You've been a friend to Wagstaff, strange as that is to say, so I figure I can let stuff go at a bit of a discount. Tithing to the Court and all that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Whatever you say, Binder. Gotta tell you, though, stuff's getting harder to come by given how you've treated Wagstaff and his apprentices. Gonna have to increase my prices to compensate."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That over-puffed bricklayer Jaspos, on the other hand, he's just like every other shit come south with the Conquest, just looking for a way to bend the Tiers over and ram his poker up-" She clears her throat. "Got a bit away from myself there."</DefaultText>
