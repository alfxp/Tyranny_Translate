      <DefaultText>You see a tall figure with a patchwork sash of animal pelts slung across her shoulder. The skin on her sunburnt face melds with a pair of naturally-flushed, freckled cheeks. She speaks energetically to two nearby villagers, animated in her depiction of a recent hunt.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She hears you approaching and spins around, spear held out playfully. "Ah-ha! Who goes there?" Her laugh is hearty, but ends abruptly as she takes note of your appearance. "Apologies, Fatebinder! I had no idea you were visiting us... forgive the jest. I've been burdened with an overabundance of energy since childhood. One way or another, it comes out." She offers a purposefully-awkward curtsy. "What can I do for you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fine folk, as far as I'm concerned. Everyone around here's better off with them. Cassandra and her students keep me supplied with fresh spear tips and arrowheads, so my life's never been easier. They spend most of their time in training, though. I think that's the real reason they're here - to pass on secrets from master to pupil in a safe place."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ha, she's a tough nut to crack. She's been pounding steel for so long that she's forgotten how to hang up the hammer and enjoy other pursuits. I first got to know her after we got to talking about hunting implements. I think she saw something in my enthusiasm for it all and we've steadily become pals. She's a much different person after she unwinds."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Cassandra's Gravelight tools seem unique. Any chance she'd part with them?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Doubt it. All she ever goes on about is chisels - moils, flates, tampers - who knew there was so much to know about wedges with handles? If you need tools, ask her! I bet she'll make them for you just to show off what she can do. But HER tools... seriously, those are probably the only things in this world she genuinely loves."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With a toothy grin, Hyacine offers a friendly wink as you approach. "Fine day out, Fatebinder. Anything you need?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Cassandra's a hard-ass - in more ways than one - but her students are better off for it. They certainly make short work of any of our requests... nails, hooks, blades, whatever you can think of. Only old Lycus didn't take too kindly to their presence, but that's because he's a half-rate smith whose blades are as limp as he is in the sack."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Anyway, I like them. I'm not too wild about the curfew they've demanded, but Cassandra insists that it's for our safety. I haven't seen any Brotherhood or bandits while out on my hunts so... it's not like we're less safe because of it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Not that there's anything wrong with having a tough exterior. She's a Master of Knapping, after all. You've got to maintain appearances!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I had to crawl real low through the brush... those critters have eyes like eagles but are too deaf to hear their own farts. I got close enough to see its nose wriggling in the air - they can actually feel you coming that way, you know - but it was too late. One swift thrust later it turned into dinner."</DefaultText>
