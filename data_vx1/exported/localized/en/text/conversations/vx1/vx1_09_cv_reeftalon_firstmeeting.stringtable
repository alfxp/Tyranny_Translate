      <DefaultText>"Still lives, yes, but does not deserve life - has abandoned cubs and Wound. Now only mother to Sleepless. Beastwoman's new brood clings to life but knows not why. Dreamless-visionless-purposeless... like Reef-Talon, now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She growls and leaps backwards, continuing to eye you with suspicion. "Wagstaff sends Fatebinder for what? To silence Reef-Talon? Fatebinder must come as Wagstaff's [url=glossary:bolverk]Bolverk[/url], as enforcer."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She slashes the stone floor, sending chunks of the masonry tumbling down towards you. "Go back to Wound, to safe lands above! Leave Reef-Talon to the pit - leave with Scourge and Sleepless." She paws along the floor and turns her back to you, bounding off into the darkness.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Reef-Talon already tried to help Wound, but now skulks in depths like wretched creature." She shakes her head vigorously from side to side. "Beastwoman does not deserve life - has abandoned cubs and Wound and now only mother to Sleepless. Reef-Talon's new brood clings to life but knows not why. Dreamless-visionless-purposeless... like Beastwoman, now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Beastwoman races towards the edge of the platform, eyes fixated on the bleeding bodies at your feet. She digs her front claws into the stone, but instead of twisting her body to descend the wall, she rakes against the surface in frustration. "No-no! Will not perform mending-rites again. Hunters' lifeblood must flow, quick-quick, away from Reef-Talon's touch."</DefaultText>
