      <DefaultText>A heavily-muscled man stands next to a mixed pile of broken floor tiles and smashed boulders, head bent in focus, sledgehammer gripped tightly in both hands. Without breaking his gaze, he calmly extends an arm out as you approach, signaling for you to wait. In one smooth motion, he whirls the sledgehammer in a precise arc, effortlessly splitting a large green-gray boulder in two. He smiles and lets out a pleased chuckle before turning to greet you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But most importantly, I created these stone sieves to clean the water." He pats one of the open-stone receptacles, pride evident in his voice. "First of its kind, and none too soon. When I came here, many were sick with the Withering Rot. The disease is in the water... It's a terrible way to go.

      <DefaultText>He circles around the platform, speaking as much to passersby as with you. "And to think that many here saw her as a leader! What leader runs in the face of adversity? Those of us that remain, we are the ones that continue to hold up Bastard's Wound. I toil every day to keep the fires of my forge running, and the people can see who they can truly rely upon!" Nearby onlookers shout and pump their fists in support, eliciting a raised fist from the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] Master in return.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The knapping tools needed are rather specialized, and I lose sleep knowing I can't replace anything I break. Since I've been missing, I imagine my tools were appropriated by my colleagues in [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]. Lohara will no doubt know of their whereabouts.

      <DefaultText>He raises an eyebrow. "I see. That's an unfortunate loss... but we can always rebuild the guild's presence in the Tiers with more cooperative leaders, like myself. As for the tools, they may have been left behind. They were quite specialized, and Lohara may have opted to clean out the Forge's equipment with local peddlers.

His voice is deep, a confident baritone that easily carries through the open air. "Forgive my rudeness - masters of the craft rarely break focus if we can help it. Old habit."

      <DefaultText>"That it is, Fatebinder. For my part, I would never do anything to disrespect [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' law." He holds up his calloused hands in a deferential pose. "The Wound isn't a normal settlement. Before [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] split these Oldwalls asunder, I would have been in complete agreement. But with the sky visible above and rivers at our very feet, it would seem reasonable to assume we're no longer within the Oldwalls, yes?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There is another man here that unfortunately holds some sway - Wagstaff, a Tidecaster. Possibly the last Tidecaster, from what I understand." He crosses his arms, his muscles tensing reflexively. "He practically founded this place years ago and, truth be told, he's the one responsible for its creation, legal or not. We don't always see eye-to-eye, but I did trust that his decision was respectful of the Overlord's will."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Then we're lucky to have you here, Fatebinder. I can assure you that I would never do or advise anything that works against [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' will. The Wound is a complicated place. Many came before me, and I've done my part to steer things correctly. As I'm sure you know, that's not always an easy task!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm just one of the leaders, Fatebinder. Though I have no doubt that I could ably and legally lead these people, we do have another voice here - the Tidecaster, Wagstaff." He leans forward, reducing his voice to a low whisper. "His kind were a touch cowardly, as I recall." He waves away the notion dramatically, speaking in a full-bodied tone again. "But not him, of course! His judgment is just unsteady at times."</DefaultText>

      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You are ultimately correct, Fatebinder. I stand by, and take responsibility for my decisions and my people, as Wagstaff will stand by his, no doubt. The Wound is a complicated place with a tangled history. I'm happy to help you unravel it, if you'd like."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Trade secrets, I'm afraid." He pauses for dramatic effect. "Except... for members of the Court. It's really a matter of using the right combination of enchanted stones, pulverized charcoal and a few precious stones in a precise arrangement. These materials act as the 'sieve' in these containers." He points towards the base of one of them, drawing your attention to water dripping out of a small opening and into a collecting bowl. "Anything that comes out of there is free of the disease."</DefaultText>

      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Now this place isn't exactly bursting with precious stones, so I had to devise a substitute. Beastman claws and teeth, when properly prepared, have the properties I need. Since they regrow over time, I've been able to collect donations from our many warriors. I do prefer using stone whenever possible, though."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ah, and I shall tell you!" He places a hand upon his belt and runs his finger across the many hammers, chisels and picks draped across his waist, stopping at a simple stone hammer. "Masters of Knapping focus on the fundamentals of all forge work. Before you can make bronze and iron, you need a hot fire in a controlled space. You need a stone forge."</DefaultText>

      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>He grips his belt firmly, puffing out his chest slightly as he speaks. "Give me a few days, and I can take a pile of rocks and fashion proper stone hammers and tools. Give me a few weeks, and I can use those tools to build a worthy forge. And with that forge, I can create anything you'd ever need."</DefaultText>

      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You should know that Wagstaff and I aren't on the best terms. He's old and... set in his ways. I've tried, believe me. I've reached out, invited him to share my fire and talk like men, but he's the sort that prefers his own company and ideas. He doesn't seem to care about people the way I do. In fact, I think he views us as irritants one must endure."</DefaultText>

      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>He sighs loudly, shaking his head with an exasperated smile. "He does help the Wound, I'll grant him that, cleansing water with his magic. His methods are different than mine, of course. Far slower. He thinks his contributions are more valuable since they can combat disease - a valuable tool, for certain - but without the volume of water produced from my stone sieves, this settlement would die in a span."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He holds a bowl of crushed rock aloft, squinting to examine its contents as he speaks. "So you've heard. It's unfortunate what happened to her. Reef-Talon arrived a year after I did. Massive creature, one of the largest beasts I've ever seen. She never spoke of her past much, but we knew she was in flight when she stumbled upon the Wound with her cubs." He pulls a fragment out of the bowl, running it slowly between his fingers.</DefaultText>

      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Whatever she fled from, it didn't stop her from devouring the Bane. She was good at it, good enough to lead the Beastmen. But Reef-Talon had something else far more important - she could heal others with a mere touch. Didn't matter if you had been raked by the Bane or fell on your own sword, she could close up your wounds and send you on your way like nothing ever happened."</DefaultText>

      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I don't think she knew, herself. She wasn't a student of her craft, not even using Beastmen mystics as a standard. What I do here - that's not an accident. It's years of controlled study and meticulous perfection. Reef-Talon simply acted on instinct, and that didn't work to anyone's benefit."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>He nods. "I agree, Fatebinder. Reef-Talon dabbled with abilities beyond her ken. She wasn't a mystic or a mage by any tradition. Everything she did was by instinct, and that had disastrous results in the end."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With a dissatisfied shake of the head, he flicks the unwanted chip into the water. "Sometimes we're better off without such miracles. Those Reef-Talon 'healed' slowly became sick. It was impossible for them to sleep, even when exhausted, and the relentless waking drove them mad. The affliction takes a while to fully take hold, but the end result is always the same."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Even worse, those bestowed with magic slowly lose their gifts." He looks towards the Forge, a pained expression visible on his face. "Now they're just known as the Sleepless. All of their life and vitality robbed and spent. A terrible end, Fatebinder. Reef-Talon couldn't face her mistakes and she fled into the Oldwalls like a coward."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"In case you haven't noticed, the Beastmen with us aren't your common feral savages. Something about this place focuses them - whether they come as our workers or on their own, they all eventually become fixated on the Bane. I've seen some hunched over, guarding our portals for hours. If any Bane come through, they'd savage them instantly. But apart from the Bane, our Beastmen aren't violent. Strange, but welcome."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He scratches his chin in thought. "I have no explanation. We never asked the Beastmen to act as our sentries. They took it on naturally, and have never complained. We do lose some to injury, but so far their defense has worked."</DefaultText>

"But do not forget, the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] answer to [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url], I am not wholly ignorant on these matters. I would contend that we have not willfully settled inside the Oldwalls - if there's water and sky overhead how is it inside anything?

Consider this my first tithe to the Court, if we continue to prosper, perhaps there might be more."

      <DefaultText>A dull crash interrupts the exchange. A Forge-helper, hands still trembling, hastily attempts to gather up the pieces of a dropped bowl. Nearby, several onlookers have gathered to observe the meeting and whisper nervously amongst themselves. "Forgive them, Fatebinder... they're understandably anxious.

      <DefaultText>"If you need to think it over, I get it. Just know that Reef-Talon had a tainted gift - she could heal people, but her healing would ultimately sicken them. The guilt of that harm drove her to exile. Way I see it, she's probably dead and her bones offer a chance for her to heal and protect Bastard's Wound once more - and for years to come, even. I won't pretend this isn't a bit of a macabre task to ask, but I assure you, it is for a good cause."</DefaultText>

A half-hearted chuckle is followed with a somber sigh. "If she is alive, tell her I'd like to her come back, even if I can't promise her that everyone else forgives her, I miss her. And if she refuses to come back, tell her Jaspos needs a rib. Maybe two."</DefaultText>
