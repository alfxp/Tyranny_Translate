      <DefaultText>"Near enough. Gwyneth gathers some stuff from topside on occasion, but most people get their food from here. We got a whole host of vegetables, and the mushrooms down here turned out to be tastier than anything grown in shit has any right to be. Got pigs, too, for the occasional feast day."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I keep everything orderly and efficient. One slip up, and we're talking MONTHS on tight rations at best. These crops can be real particular about the kind of water they like. Give them too much, too little, the wrong kind, and next thing you know they're limp and brown."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That I do. Have since shortly after we arrived here. I may have been a mercenary up top, but down here, I've developed into quite the farmhand." She chuckles. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She sighs, then leans forward, lowering her voice. "You being a Fatebinder, I thought you might be able to get to the heart of a little trouble we're having up here. The crops aren't doing too swift - veggies or mushrooms - and at the rate they're withering... well, if the farm dies, the Wound starves."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I've kept both eyes on the water being used, and I haven't seen a solitary mistake made. Each crop gets the right amount of the right kind of water at the right time. Ain't just that - the plants are going bad faster than last time, too. If I had to guess, somebody's sneaking the plants the wrong water when I'm not around."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"How would a person know such a thing for sure without seeing it herself? All I know is that it's sure similar to what happened before. The water's got these real distinct colors to them, though, on account of the ways they're made, and I've told everyone here a dozen times which one's which."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You're the Fatebinder, I figured you'd know." Her brow wrinkles as she considers. "You could always ask the people who work the farm, see if they seen anything out of the ordinary.

      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well, the plants are all withering, and it looks real similar to when the water got mixed up before. Do you have time to look into it, Fatebinder? I'm worried something awful we'll lose the whole crop if nothing's done."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, every plant is different, but the water situation down here's real touchy. Jaspos' filters work for the topside plants, since it's more or less what they're used to. Those stone jugs of his get rid of whatever makes people sick while keeping in the nutrients my veggies need."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That explains how the wrong water made it to the crops, but not who did it." She frowns. "Wish it were more. Not knowing the culprit, it'll be tough preventing further harm. And there's no convincing anyone Wagstaff's responsible on the strength of moss alone."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Think I'd keep them here after what they done? I spelled it out clear to them - jump the Wound - that breach, I mean - or get tossed in when the Beastmen finished sharpening their claws on them. Even offered 'em their jobs back if they made the jump. Suffice it to say, they didn't."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Strange enough, this ain't the first time something like this has occurred. A while back, one of the greener farmhands got it in his hollow head that any water is good water and was paying no mind to which he watered with what. An honest mistake, but caused us no end of grief."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Give that water to the mushrooms, though, and they stop glowing. Then they shrivel up, no good for anything. No idea why - I figure the topside nutrients kill them. Wagstaff's water is about as pure as it gets, though, and the mushrooms take to it just fine."</DefaultText>
