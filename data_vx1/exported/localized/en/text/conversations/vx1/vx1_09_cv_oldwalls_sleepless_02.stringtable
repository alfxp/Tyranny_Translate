      <DefaultText>This young woman teeters dangerously close to the edge of the chasm, calling out to someone in an airy, almost melodic tone. "Where is your sweet song today, Lullaby? We miss you so..." Her companion tugs at her armband and she slowly spins around. Neither seem to recall their earlier flight from your presence.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Frail and feeble, she offers little resistance as you put her to rest.

As she grows still, her companion turns to you, his expression distant and confused. You kill him swiftly, ending his misery in one clean stroke.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She either ignores or doesn't hear your words, electing instead to stare directly into the blue gem. "Is this where my dreams have fled? This pretty spark... its glow so cold, and yet as a flame to my numb hands." She draws the crystal to her cheek.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Hold out a waterskin.] "You look parched. Would you trade the torchkey for some water?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She shifts her gaze towards you - the mention of water appears to momentarily distract her from the torchkey in her hands. You uncork the waterskin and dribble some of its contents onto the floor. Its sound or smell summons forth an instinctual response - with surprising agility, she snatches the waterskin from your hands and leaves the torchkey in its place. She drinks deeply and greedily from it, continuing to do so as you leave.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh, would you like to feel its light as well? But of course!" She walks towards you with small, rapid steps, practically gliding across the floor, and places the crystal in your hand. "Be careful not to stare too long... sometimes its heat is too much." She closes her eyes, lost in either reverie or memory - you cannot tell.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She licks her parched lips and continues to commune wordlessly with the stone, tracing her finger across its many facets. "Why bother with torchkeys when one has such a beautiful stone?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You mean I might get to join Lullaby down below? That would be nice... to hear her song once again. So pretty... so calming..." She smiles and hugs the crystal to her chest.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You grab her hand and press a stack of rings into it. She stares at the metal blankly, barely acknowledges its presence. With a smile and a shrug, she lets the rings fall from her hands and returns her attention to the torchkey in her hands. The rings roll into the darkness and drop into the water.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Are you one of the dreamless too?" She rocks and sways in place, running her hands across her sash in long, languid motions. You spy an object in her hand, its blue glint piercing the gloom. As she cradles it close to her chest, you recognize the characteristic shape of an Oldwalls torchkey.</DefaultText>
