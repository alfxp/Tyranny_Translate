      <DefaultText>A group of unkempt, filthy commoners huddle among a motley of barrels and boxes. The heavy stenches of sweat, stale food, and grass cling to the still air.

The presumptive leader of the group stands as you enter and moves towards you, weapon in hand.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The approaching woman's olive cheeks seem drawn and sallow. Dark circles shadow eyes that survey you before searching over your shoulder. Seemingly reassured by her brief inspection, she lowers her weapon slightly so that it's not pointed directly at your chest.

Her muscles remains taut, however, her stance that of a veteran soldier ready to respond at the first sign of aggression.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You didn't bring the Chorus in with you, and if you were [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url], you'd have loudly bragged about your pedigree already... so that leaves me wondering, just who are you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fair enough. If you're a free agent, maybe you're willing to keep our presence down here a secret?" Her eyes search your face. "Maybe you're even willing to spill a little Chorus crimson?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We need to get back inside the mountain. We'd come out..." She falls silent for a moment, and a slight shudder runs through her. "We'd come out to scavenge for supplies. When we got back, we found crimson assholes crawling all over the place."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well it wasn't our first choice of homes but... we've taken shelter in a nearby cave. While we were out looking for supplies, these Chorus goons somehow buried the cave entrance with rubble. We could excavate a path, but not with Chorus spears prodding our rears while we dig."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There was always the chance we'd get stuck out here, that the mountains would move again, or [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]-forbid, [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] would come back to finish what he started."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her sigh reveals profound relief, and she accompanies it with a nod. "Thank you. Be extraordinarily careful with it. You don't want to be within twenty paces when the paste meets the air. Hunker down behind some rubble up top, then lob it at the cave entrance."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I saw the Ocean Fire from here - like a Spire of living flame. Felt it, too! I imagine it was something like that when [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] struck down the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A Fatebinder? Fantastic." Her tone suggests that it's anything but. "You here to kill us? Or can we convince you to keep our presence secret from those Chorus madmen?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So Wags- ...er, one of our specialists, he cooked us up an alchemical compound called Ocean's Fire. Burns as fast and hot as a Wrathcaster's spell. Set correctly, it'll clear the cave entrance out in an instant, but if it gets bumped wrong, say by some idiot Chorus conscripts, we all meet the void well-charred."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Used to be more. Used to be a mercenary. But no one's offering coin for a blade anymore. If you weren't born north of the Gates of Judgment, there's nothing for a warrior save cloth of crimson or a mass grave. Red or dead, as they say." She sighs. "So I stopped warring.
