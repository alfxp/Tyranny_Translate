      <DefaultText>The man bound before you wears [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] violet crusted with patches of dried blood, the faint blue light of an Oathbound scout's sigil shimmering unsteadily through a thick layer of grime. He watches you approach from under a lowered brow, his features sunken and dark. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There's something profoundly wondrous in outliving your enemies." He grins, something feral in the way his lip curls over his eyeteeth. "Get these ropes off of me, and I'll tell you why I'm out here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Cut deep, then." He raises his chin, exposing his throat. "[url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] protects."

You grab him by the throat and slam his head hard into the adjacent stone guardrail, marking it with a slick red smear. His muscles tense, but he remains trussed. A rivulet of blood rolls down his cheek, and his eyes go glassy. Your grip on his throat tightens as you crush his windpipe and choke the life out of him. Finally his form goes slack beneath you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My team wasn't the first [url=glossary:iron guard]Iron Guard[/url] Acalos sent to this estate. The other never reported back. We were dispatched to recover whatever was left of them, but we found precisely nothing - no gear, no evidence of a fight, nothing that seemed a sign left for other [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] to find." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We canvased the area pretty thoroughly before Rholes showed up. Only place we'd stayed out of was the cave in the back. The hole scared Rholes shitless, though, so he closed it up." He looks towards the jumbled pile of stone to the north. "Wish we'd gotten a chance to check in there for the first crew. Then at least I'd have something to take back to Iron Hearth."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You know what I know, Fatebinder. I need to return to Iron Hearth and report in." He looks at his arms. "And get these limbs straightened out. No enjoyment in that, I promise, but at least it'll distract me from... everything else."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Oathbound locks his eyes on yours. "Fatebinder. You're said to be a close ally of the General, so there's something you need to know. We had a secondary objective out here, the original reason that Iron Hearth dispatched the first squad to this backwater. The legion lost track of an Earthshaker out here a few spans back. Chances are he went as rogue as his Archon before him." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I appreciate the sentiment, and normally I'd say risk it, but my arms were both broken and neither set right. I'll need a sawbones to break them again before they'll mend straight."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His right eye socket seems a bit darker than his left, as if he bears a near-healed bruise, and the sour scent of mingled sweat and urine wafts from him.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Thank you, Fatebinder." Hyrax straightens as you release him, then stretches, his joints cracking loudly. He scowls at his arms, which were obviously badly broken and have healed twisted by his bonds. "I appreciate the aid."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Then Rholes hit us. At night, by surprise, like a motherless coward. We had set watch, obviously, but one of his mages did something to Corex that kept him from calling out. It was the pain of him burning that woke me and the others, the only reason we were able to kill the Chorusmen we did." He shudders, then releases a sigh. "No one else survived.
