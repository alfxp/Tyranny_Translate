      <DefaultText>"I think you're well-acquainted with the manor and its grounds at this point. My father's legacy and my inheritance, reduced to rubble and ash. They call it the Shattered Bastion." He runs his fingers across his eyes, tracing the dark circles that ring them. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I suppose my father's optimism was to blame. Before the Overlord's forces even set foot in the Bastard Tier, my father invited Tiersmen of all persuasions into these walls to resist [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] - didn't matter who you were."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He didn't cleave to tradition. I'm sure that passing women the land and stuffing men aboard the ships made sense when our ancestors needed cleaner lines of inheritance... men drown so women wear the crown, as they say."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There's little to do to stave off boredom when you're trapped in this crack in the world. Tensions run high, and unless you blow off steam by bedding or beating your neighbors, you need alternatives." He hesitates, cringing as he continues. </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Too much good fortune is how! We place our safest bets on the strongest Beastmen, and of late they've been falling more often than the weak. Only Mell stands to profit from that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Some of us have talked about it, yes. I suppose you can say I'm one of the... devoted." His cheeks flush a mottled crimson, but Rostrom banishes his shame away with a shrug. </DefaultText>

      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I mentioned my suspicions to both Jaspos and Wagstaff, but they're too fixated on one another to pay this any mind. So I've no one else to grumble to other than myself."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No, no, not Mell. Have you seen our [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] guest, Telesophia? She's the one strung up like a decoration in the middle of the settlement." He begins a hearty chuckle but grimaces in pain from the exertion. </DefaultText>

      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I thought it a risk to bring the matter to a Fatebinder, but I can see that you have our well-being in mind. At least now I know to keep an eye out for that Scribe." Rostrom nods with gratitude.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Truly? Killing our own is... well, something I'd expect from [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url], not from us." His maimed arm twitches as he speaks. </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A bit of a blunt solution for my tastes, but I'm no Fatebinder. At least Mell can't take advantage of our idleness anymore."  He considers the news while sighing through pursed lips. </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That sounds like the non-response of a practiced bureaucrat. I'd almost prefer you just tell me you were paid off." He squints at you, brow furrowed. Then his courage dissipates and he shrinks back from you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Rostrom Lenk, son of the late Rostrom Volus. I saw you in the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url] shortly after [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s arrival. We've come a long way from then, haven't we?" He chuckles mirthlessly at the memory.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My father never married, but that didn't stop him from asserting control over these lands, Tiersman laws-be-damned. I'm all that remains of his three heirs."</DefaultText>

      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"My father never set foot in water. Goes to show how you can overcome any eccentricity if your coffers are full of rings. They speak more persuasively than you or I ever could."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My father would be enraged if he saw me today, pacing the mushroom beds or leading swine to slaughter. This life may not be worth much, but it's something, at least."</DefaultText>

      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The odds Mell sets look right enough, but maybe that [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] is being crafty in a way I can't understand. Something just doesn't feel right."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My family estate is no more, but I've managed to stash away some of our relics. They'll fetch you some rings at the very least. Here, for your efforts." He hands you a satchel that jingles with assorted trinkets. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder... greetings to you." Though unkempt and draped in disheveled rags, he bows deeply in the style of northern Tiersman nobility. You observe that his right arm is emaciated and frail, seemingly rooted in place.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Rostrom House is but a memory, now. Prior to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' arrival, we were a successful merchant family with routes that extended from Azure's capital to Ardent's coasts."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No, I lack my father's ambition. I've seen where it leads. Besides, I have little to offer these folks beyond a memory of more optimistic days." He rubs a thick scar running down his arm. </DefaultText>

      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Once the Tier fell, [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] arrived to make an example of my family. That monster sundered the whole damn mountain along with my home."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>61</ID>
      <DefaultText>His maimed arm quivers from some unknown exertion. Eventually, a single finger extends downward and points at his right leg, heavily scarred and bent at an unnatural angle. </DefaultText>

      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You'll want to talk to Mell. Might not be a half-bad idea if you manage to clear my debts in the process. That scribe has collected more rings from my mangled hands than I can remember. Should be a crime to steal from a cripple."</DefaultText>

      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Not exactly tolerant for Beastmen, that one - but she knows how to size them up. Mell got the idea to use her insight, so she more or less sets the odds. You'd have to get the details from her, though."</DefaultText>
