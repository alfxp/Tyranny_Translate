      <DefaultText>The mural before you depicts two Beastmen-like figures rising from the floor, larger-than-life in stature and presence. They both carry upon their backs massive rectangular tower-like structures. Between the columns are what look like corridors of the Oldwalls, twisting and turning at right angles.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Both forms appear to be bracing against the structure, and taken as a pair, their posture suggests they are holding up or supporting the structure between them.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I find that hard to imagine. The Oldwalls, for all of their maddening twists and chasms, consist primarily of straight, ordered lines and even, geometric shapes. That's the very opposite of the Beastmen."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The two figures depicted on either side of the structure are drawn in remarkable detail, their proportions and anatomy seem nearly identical to Beastmen.

      <DefaultText>Sandstone-colored borders define the edges of the structure supported by the Beastmen. The cross-section reminds you of vertical maps drawn of the Oldwalls, a confusing series of connected corridors and passageways rises from floor to ceiling, all of it saturated with cloudy streaks of blue, red and purple.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The blue-toned paint used to portray the Bane-like shapes radiates the slightest hint of light - noticeable only when near-darkness falls upon the surface.

The same paint is used to portray the Bane patterns that snake about the limbs of the two Beastmen. On close inspection, small tendrils of blue also seem to link the Beastmen to the towers they hold aloft.</DefaultText>
