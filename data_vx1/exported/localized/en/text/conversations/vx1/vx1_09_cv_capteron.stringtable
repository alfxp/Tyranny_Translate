      <DefaultText>A middle-aged man nods to you, clutching a small apple crate in one arm. A well-worn scrap of parchment pokes out of his balled fist, charcoal tally marks visible on its exposed surface. "Well met, traveler. Sorry, I was counting these out for Hermod and didn't see you coming. Welcome to South Haven."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm not sure what's really all that worthy of note." He scratches his chin, inadvertently smudging it with charcoal. "We've got the river and the sea nearby and live by what they bring us on the good seasons, trade for what we don't have when our luck dries up. If you're bored already, good - I think [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces were bored too and seemed to ignore us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh, their arrival was the biggest change we've experienced in a long time! It's been... maybe two years? This guarded entourage came to town and we all thought we were being invaded but nope - just a bunch of craftsmen booking passage out of the port south of here. When they arrived, they were all ill with fever and needed to rest. Since Old Lyones knocked off, we let the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] use her house."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As he turns his back, you halt his escape with a quick jab to his kidney. He collapses upon the ground, clutching his side in agony. He pleads between pained gasps for air. "Mercy! I'll comply. I won't say anything. I promise!"

He crawls away from you, slowly staggering to his feet before finally breaking into a sprint towards the edge of the village.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh, she might leave? I... I didn't realize that." His shoulders sag and he grows quiet.
			
"Well, maybe it wouldn't be so bad if I took the tools. Cassandra always says that knappers can make whatever they need. And I think she's taken to South Haven, so I'm sure staying in town would be good for her. Maybe she'll finally have time to speak with me, too. Alright, I'll help you.

      <DefaultText>You hear the rustling of leaves and brush in the distance, followed by a the snap of a breaking branch and a dull thud on the ground. Capteron runs around the corner of the nearby building, wincing and rubbing his backside. He's a mess, his body covered with mud and leaves.

I gave them fresh water as usual, and then slipped the tools over the side of the building. Some of them got caught in the tree and lost in the brush...
