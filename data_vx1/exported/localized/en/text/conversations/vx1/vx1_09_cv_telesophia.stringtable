      <DefaultText>A broad-shouldered woman in [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] raiment dangles against the nearby column, suspended by her wrists. Though still garbed in the iron breastplate of her unit, she is without helmet and appears unusually at-ease in her compromised position. A nearby settler engages in friendly conversation with the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] - she peers down at him, listening with dutiful patience.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The last lure hooked that trout just fine, but it took the whole thing downstream with it when the knot gave out! I wrapped the line several times, just like you said. You aren't fibbing me, are you 'Sophia?"</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Jaspos' bronze should be strong enough for trout - no way the hook broke in its mouth. You probably didn't wrap the line around itself enough times. Remember what I said, it's at least five twists around before you loop and tie it off to form the clinch. Just try it. It'll work. And if the fish bite, I expect you to save some of that trout for me!"</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"They have, in a sense. The Beastwoman leader of the local pack ordered that I be strung up until dead. Guess she didn't understand Ashe's Aegis, so who's laughing now?"</DefaultText>
