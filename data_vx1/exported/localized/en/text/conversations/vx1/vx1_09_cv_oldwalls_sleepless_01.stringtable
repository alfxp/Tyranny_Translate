      <DefaultText>"I've lost it... gone, gone, forever lost." A glassy-eyed man sways on his feet, his countenance sickly pale and ashen half-circles clinging to the undersides of his eyes. He stares forward, gaze unfocused, seemingly unaware of your presence. "It must be in the water... I should keep swimming, swimming, always upstream...."

As you step closer, he turns to face you and squints his eyes. "You there. Have you seen it?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Bane?" His irises wander to the corners of his eyes, as if doing so would reveal creatures hidden beside him. "Oh they don't pay us any mind, not any more. Lullaby tells them no. Lullaby protects."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His brow furrows as he confronts your question. "I... I knew just a moment ago. I lost something important, I did. I'm so tired. How long have I been..." He trails off, unable to complete his thought.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He blinks at you without comprehension. "I'm awake, aren't I? This isn't a dream?" He reaches out and grasps your shoulder loosely, then firmly. "My thoughts come and go, and I sometimes can't tell if I still live." He pats himself on the check several times, each with increasing intensity. "I'm here... Iâ€™m here. I'm still here."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm one of the afflicted... the Sleepless, I think is what they call us. It was Reef-Talon. Her touch healed me, stopped the blood from spilling out." He runs his hand along a vicious-looking scar bisecting his chest. "She took something in exchange. I'm alive enough to know I'm hollow." He stops and scrutinizes his hands. "Hollow... hollow... hol-" As he raises his head, his eyes show no signs of recognition. "Have you seen it? I've lost something."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As his blood spills from the corners of his mouth, he continues to softly mumble in earnest.

"Have you seen it? I've lost... lost... some-"</DefaultText>
