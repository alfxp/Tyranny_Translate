      <DefaultText>A slender woman picks through produce in a carried sack. Her hands appear focused on finding a particular piece of fruit, but her eyes are intent on the other shoppers in the marketplace below.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"She mentioned a place called 'Phlogiston' - think she means the village that used to be called Babbling Springs before the war - out in the Contested Lands. And that's as much as I know about where to find her. If you can't find her there, maybe she's taken her chances at the Library itself."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A man passes by her, accidentally dropping a pouch as he goes. She bends down to retrieve it, and hands it back to him. "Careful, you almost lost this." He takes the pouch with a blushing smile and promptly walks away, clutching the pouch close to his side.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I didn't realize I had an audience - must be a sign I'm slowing down after all these years. Don't worry, nothing underhanded, just trying to repay a debt on the quiet. Certainly someone such as yourself understands the need for discretion."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No need to search me, Fatebinder, I've got nothing worth-" as she flourishes her hand to gesticulate her point, a slip of parchment slides out of sleeve. She grabs the sheet out of the air with a sudden burst of reflexes, and looks at you with a red-handed smile. "I uh... forgot I had that there?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh, this?" Her hands briefly vanish within the folds of her skirt, only to reappear with the pouch in question. "Scraps of parchment. I meant to deliver this to the Court after acquiring it from a traveling [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url]. It may be magical in nature, or contain knowledge forbidden by [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]. Please, take it! I'm only happy to do my part."
	
She steps back and observes you, continuing to maintain an air of pleasant attentiveness. "Is there anything else I can do for you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Me? No, I'm Xantha. There was a Melitta here but she died back in 402 so... either you're running very late or you're in the wrong place. Sorry, wish I could help." She cranes her neck and looks around the market, scanning the faces of the shoppers.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Phoibe sends me the occasional missive.

      <DefaultText>She unfurls the scroll she took pains to hide from you, revealing a turn-of-the-century map of the Tiers. "Not according to the last Fatebinder I asked - It's not [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] lore, if that's what you mean. Just an old turn-of-the-century map of the Tiers - more a curiosity than anything else. A [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] chap paid handsomely for one a year ago so I've been trying to collect more of them."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Rummaging through her belongings, you find numerous bits of thread, small tools, and parchment scraps seemingly pulled from random tomes.

One scrap of parchment comes to your attention - it's the fragment of a missive from Phoibe saying that she is headed to the [url=glossary:burning library]Burning Library[/url] in search of things to recover, and looks forward to meeting up with Melitta to talk prices.</DefaultText>
