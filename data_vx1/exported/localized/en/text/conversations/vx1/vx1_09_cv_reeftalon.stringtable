      <DefaultText>The Beastwoman waits by the dust-caked altar, head bent downward in contemplation. A deep, gravely rumble emanates from her chest as you cross the chamber's threshold.

With a loud chuff, she turns to face you. A fierce pair of ice-blue eyes watch you with murderous intensity.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Stalkers and hunters. Bane and mystics - all come to spill Reef-Talon's lifeblood. Beastwoman must climb deep-deep, paw where lights do not follow." She watches you intently, her ice-blue eyes piercing the chamber's shadow.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She places her knuckles upon the cold stone floor, muscles coiled menacingly. "Fatebinder creeps to Beastwoman's den bathed in blood of Wound-warriors. Why should Reef-Talon speak with human?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Human is arrogant. Speaks of Sleepless like rival clan, as if simple blood rite can tame dreamless wanderers. Does Fatebinder not realize that poison within Reef-Talon gives birth to Sleepless?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So human comes ready to hunt?" A low rumble creeps from the back of her throat, only to be dismissed with a loud chuff. "But Fatebinder has not bared fangs yet. Is willing to listen perhaps."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>11</ID>
      <DefaultText>She snorts and raises a claw in warning. "Fatebinder is fearless, like overconfident whelp before first hunt. Would human paw to Shadowhunter den and demand [url=glossary:prima]Prima[/url]'s life? To [url=glossary:stonestalker]Stonestalker[/url] den?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her eyes widen in alarm and her lips part to reveal massive, yellowed fangs. "Fatebinder comes to shed blood! But human speaks truth. Reef-Talon has failed tribe, poisoned clan. Will not submit to hunters, but... will also not return to Wound."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Beastwoman only knows that Sleepless were birthed from mystic-strength. From Reef-Talon's corrupting touch. Dark powers extinguish life-spark of dying human.

      <DefaultText>"Same question ponders Reef-Talon. Scourge-beasts seek blood of Beastwoman, but never of Sleepless kith, even noisy Sleepless! Reef-Talon thinks Sleepless cast no scent for Scourge-beasts to smell - no dreams to tempt ancient hungers."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>For a moment, her eyes grow distant and shed their intensity. "Reef-Talon has lived four lives. First life, was free Mantaborn in islands near human-lands called Stalwart. Second life, was as slave." She chuffs and banishes the thought with a shake of her head. "Third life was [url=glossary:prima]Prima[/url] to Wound-tribe. And now Reef-Talon lives fourth life as wretched outcast, skulking in deep pits of Oldwalls."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you draw your weapon, the Sleepless in the chamber react with a discordant chorus of wails, drawing in closer to protect Reef-Talon. "Back! Scamper-flee-escape! Do not raise blunt-claws to Fatebinder. Only Reef-Talon must answer challenge!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Beastwoman did not envision this." Reef-Talon's hackles raise in alarm. "Fatebinder speaks of possible truth. Sleepless poison is created by mending-touch. What if same corruption grows stronger and spreads from afar?" She glances down at the leathery pads of her palm . "Perhaps Reef-Talon has been cursed for trespassing where human [url=glossary:prima]Prima[/url] called [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] forbids."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Beastwoman snorts defiantly but averts her gaze. Slowly, she bobs her head in agreement. "Fatebinder is correct. Reef-Talon should not hide or run from strange power, like cowardly pack whelp not fit for breeding. Must learn to dominate mystic-strength, just as Alpha controls unruly pack."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A disheveled Lexeme shuffles into the chamber, interrupting Reef-Talon's moment of self-reflection. "Then we're agreed! I had a feeling you'd rouse her to action. We should move quickly. My mind wanders and I'll not squander this chance while I still have my wits!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She rests back on her haunches and chuffs dismissively. "Reef-Talon has already fouled packmates. Mending-rites closed rips and tears but left empty husk in place of human-kith.

      <DefaultText>"Mantaborn are warriors of land and ocean. More free than land-trapped beastmen! Island-kith are not quarrelsome like Tiers tribes. Not always leading packs to rend-rake-kill rivals over parched land. Island warriors respect tribe boundaries where sand meets water."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Beastwoman has no need to fight other tribes. Mother ocean provides great-maws and deep-lurkers to test warriors and mystics. To keep Mantaborn strong." Reef-Talon's mouth stretches into a knowing smile. "Has Fatebinder wrestled with black-eyed great-maw with head and tail of spears? Or killed clear-skin lurker with glowing fangs and snakes for limbs? Has human ever heard deadly song of stinging-cloud and stayed awake? Mantaborn does not need tribal war to stay fierce. Hunt. Bleed. Feed pack-mates." She bobs her head at the fond memory. "Was good life."</DefaultText>

The hair on the Beastwoman's back stands erect as she speaks. "Saw only red-red-red! Awoke to butchered captors... and freedom!
