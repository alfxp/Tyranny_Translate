      <DefaultText>A tall, heavily-scarred Blood Chanter stands before three bound and bloodied Sages. She raises her palm, bright orange with an unnatural heat, and presses it to one of the captive's eyes. His agonized screams blend together with the hiss of cooking flesh, ending only after he slumps over, passed out.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Before the Bloodchanter can react, you step forward and push a knife through the bandages covering her ribs. Callia lets out a choked gasp and falls to the ground, where she continues to flail and hiss. You smash your knee into the side of her neck and pin her with it, twisting the knife while her limbs twitch weakly underneath you. It's not long before she grows still.</DefaultText>
