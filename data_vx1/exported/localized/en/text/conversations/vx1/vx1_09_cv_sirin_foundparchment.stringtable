      <DefaultText>As you raise the dry, cracked parchment from its container, Sirin cranes her neck to examine what you've uncovered. "Oh, you've found some kind of... is that writing? It looks kind of weird."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I thought you might let me see it, given that half the reason I follow you is to learn about the world." Her voice floats to you softly, sweet, in rhythm with the flickers of Oldwalls light caught in the gem at her forehead. "Maybe more than half."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She takes the paper, cradling it carefully in her thin fingers. "Wow. It's pretty, almost like poetry. Very repetitive poetry - see how these symbols get repeated constantly?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ugh! Seriously?! Fine then. Go have some crusty old man drool on it or whatever." She turns away on her heel and exhales a final snort.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That's a pretty silly theory. Paper isn't music. It can't even sing!" She chuckles. "But here, let me see it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Maybe..." She carefully supports the ancient vellum in her small hands. "If it's notation, it's unlike anything I've ever seen though. Maybe if you took me to where you found it, there might be something that would illuminate it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She shrugs, passing the parchment back. "It feels familiar, but I can't tell you why. Maybe you should find someone more accustomed to reading crusty old papers to study it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Not illuminate like scribes do with parchment. Like provide insight. Whatever, you know what I meant. Let me know if you want to return to Bastard's Wound."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Peering over Sirin's shoulder, Lantry stares at the paper with a sigh. "That's my cue to confess my ignorance - I'm not familiar with the this particular script. Perhaps we'll stumble upon a reference piece in our travels, or meet someone who knows this writing."</DefaultText>
