      <DefaultText>A barrel-chested man surveys the areas with a stern expression, eying you nonchalantly as you approach. A large horseshoe mustache traces the top of his mouth before racing down to his chin. When he speaks, the bristles nearly mask his lips. "Well met, Fatebinder."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He peers over you at the plume of smoke rising into the sky. "Oh for [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' sake! I told Ragnall not to keep those extracts close together." He runs off to investigate the accident.</DefaultText>
