      <DefaultText>"Ah! Another incredible find, Fatebinder!" The scribe gingerly takes the offered document.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText> "Yes, yes, these glyphs, and here, the grain of the sheet.... this matches closely with other documents we've found in the Oldwalls. Whether that means it was left by those who created the Oldwalls, or by those who came later to study them, I would hesitate to conjecture."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No one can simply decipher texts found in the Oldwalls. At best, a few learned scribes can interpret the writings left in those depths to uncover lost aspects of sigils. Even that requires time and effort."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Apologies, Fatebinder. I should have realized, considered, rather, your relationship to the text."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This is a particularly unusual specimen. These repeated glyphs may be some manner of mathematical notation, expressing the relationships between specific values - think of fractions of a whole, for instance. Yet they seem simply listed rather than part of any equation... and at regular intervals, as well."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh!" Sirin unleashes a sudden, sharp laugh. "Oh oh! I know what it is! I mean, I think I do. You're basically describing music!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"While there remains every possibility that this is some manner of ritual or mathematical proof... perhaps something even more mundane, such as a record of accounting or recipe... what the document most reminds me of is the notation utilized to record music."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I would suggest that you approach the Archon of Song with it, but... well, yes." He clears his throat. "I apologize that I could not be of further service."</DefaultText>

      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>"If anyone could shed light on this, I imagine it would be the Archon of Song. If my inkling is correct and it's some sort of music, her special gift might provide insight. Were I you, I would avail myself of her expertise."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"When people want to save music for posterity, they write it down. It's a little like language, but also different, because the writing has to convey rhythm and pitch. I studied numerous examples at court." She scowls. "Supposedly written music used to be more common, but [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] has a fairly restricted aural aesthetic."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Exactly! And the distance between the glyphs is regular, so they must somehow indicate rhythm with the symbols."</DefaultText>

      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yeah, for like hours. Maybe 'the adults' would be better served by listening to the Archon of Song instead."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm taking this." She plucks the parchment from the [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url]'s hands. "I'll let you know what I figure out, Fatebinder."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What? Of course not! I mean, perhaps a little. I can't help it - I have very sensitive hearing."</DefaultText>
