      <DefaultText>"I didn't like the man but... his death was never part of my plan - his skills were invaluable around here, even I can admit that. Still, he never could accept authority... not from me, not from the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url]. What a waste."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"My magic carved the original swath of safety from the Bane and let the first of us cling to life. I've put all my efforts into keeping this place alive... but I mean... what else am I doing to do aside from flirting with the lasses?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"So there is at least some safe harbor at which for us to dock?" The old man snorts with resignation. "That'll have to do. With any luck, we may even find old friends and loved ones amongst your followers. Or so I will hope."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Indeed, and it's keeping me young. Insipid Moniker is quite the student. Some days I worry she's maybe too good at signing magic... good thing the Blood Chanters never trained her. "</DefaultText>
