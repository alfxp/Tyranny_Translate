      <DefaultText>A bearded, weathered figure stands by the pool's edge, eyes closed in concentration. His face, uncharitably weathered from years of sun and wind, is a collection of deep, intertwining creases wreathed by a brittle-looking gray mane. One disapproving eye snaps open as you approach. "Hrmm."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He shakes his head. "I'm the only true leader, as I've said before. But I won't belabor the point." He clears his throat. "Three years ago, I stumbled across these Oldwalls and very quickly found I wasn't alone - a clutch of hungry and sick Tiersmen had stumbled upon this enclave as well. I had come here to escape [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces but... I'm nothing if not driven by noblesse oblige. I decided I'd weigh anchor for a bit and help out."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His eyes glaze over at the mention of his rival's name. "Ugh. If only that rock pounder would just. Shut. Up. He loves the sound of his own voice." He grips the roping on his waist, squeezing it with a clenched fist. "Unfortunately, his Forge is on the upper level, so his soliloquies flow down here to ensure my misery. This place has better acoustics than the Academy of Tides... lucky me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He cocks an eyebrow. "Ah, Reef-Talon. Curious case, that one. She pawed her way into these caves a year ago with her cubs. A vicious fighter, for certain. Bane of the Bane, I liked to say. She took charge of the tribe but had a curious way about her... the most fascinating beast I'd ever met: oddly pensive, strangely polite, prone to bathing."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder, if it may dissuade you from a future visit, consider speaking with our town steward, Mell. He has no backbone, so he'll dutifully answer any questions you have. Just pay no mind to Jaspos, unless you enjoy the company of braggarts." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The old man stomps on the end of a staff, flipping it upward into his hands in an unexpected display of agility. He leans against it and looks at you through narrowed eyes, head bent upward at a disdainful angle. "A Fatebinder... well, this is going to be a shit day, isn't it?" He mutters further to himself, unintelligibly, before speaking up again. "Out with it, then. I'm ready for whatever's going to spew out of your ballast hole."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hmph. JUST to talk. That remains to be seen. But who am I to question a Fatebinder? You should know that my hostility is rarely personal.

      <DefaultText>"If you've come looking for Wagstaff, you've found him. No doubt you're swimming in regret already." He grips his staff, watching you intently. "I have that effect on people, and it suits me fine. Took years to perfect! If you've come expecting supplication, you're in for a frustrating wait. It's not personal, Fatebinder. I prefer being disliked... it keeps the neighbors at bay."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They are chosen with precision, in fact. Displeasure, annoyance... I mean to convey these as unambiguously as possible. A Fatebinder has discovered our reclusive little hideaway. What reaction did you expect?" He points a shaky finger towards anxious settlers gathered across the bridge. "People are terrified of what you might do, and for good reason."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He glares at you, gripping his staff tightly. His hands encircle the shaft, squeezing it with white knuckled rage. "I speak plainly, Fatebinder. And what's plain as day is that you've stumbled upon a settlement that shuns attention." He points a shaky finger towards anxious onlookers gathered across the bridge. "You've sent this whole place into a panic - I'll grant you, that might not have been your aim, but when this place is out of sorts, I'm out of sorts."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hmph. That's the most cordial thing anyone's ever said to me. A worthy goal, Fatebinder. Though my discomfort is just a drop in the ocean. Do you see all those settlers, cowering behind doorways and wetting themselves? You bring a lot of uncertainty with you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I assume someone pointed you towards me to speak for the settlement. If there are matters to discuss, then so be it. I may not like it, but I do lead these people... frankly, only because nobody else can. That stone-straddling fool, Jaspos, will talk himself into believing he's up to the task, but don't believe his bluster for a moment." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He raises an eyebrow, observing you with unmasked skepticism. "Unexpected, Fatebinder... perhaps your visit was worth the interruption. Making a life without someone breathing down my neck is all I've ever want. Thank...you?" He appears genuinely disgusted with his halfway-cordial offering, and shakes his head violently to banish the feeling. "Hrmph."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With a satisfied nod, Wagstaff cups his hand and bellows. "The Court will extend mercy!"

"Life here in the Wound isn't easy, and we always assumed outsiders will bring death, not help. Your leniency is the sort of surprise we needed in these difficult times. And though I never would have guessed this, your arrival may be the sign of good things to come."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There's an old rival of mine still out there, a [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] named Phoibe." He twists the rope on the end of his belt, grimacing. "Yes, we're from rival schools, no, this isn't just a case of an unsettled score. I'd live and let live but... she poses an actual threat to the Wound. She had knowledge of my plans to journey north to trace [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]'s path in these mountains, which may expose us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With little warning, you strike him viciously across the nose, knocking the old man to the ground. He slowly rises to his knees and cradles the wound, blood dripping down his wincing face. "Ugh. Unsurprising, but... still painful." He traces an arcane sigil with one hand, cupping his face with a glowing palm. Still grimacing, he picks himself up, nose now blood-free but visibly crooked. "You've made your point, Fatebinder. As have I. Let's just get this over with."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yeah, we're guilty. I won't bother arguing that." He scratches his chin, appearing unfazed by your threat. "That’s what you Northerners do, make up arcane rules about forbidden spaces... is it just to remind us that you can? Why does living here displease the Overlord? Who knows!" He hurls his staff to the ground, shaking with frustration.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And if people find the ingenuity to survive in this shithole, then of course the correct answer is to murder them. Certainly not to leave them in peace, or even to extract a meaningful bribe to feed your starving ego.

      <DefaultText>With a wave of his fingers, his staff flies off the floor and back into his hands. He smashes it into one of the nearby crystals, creating a vibration that reverberates throughout the settlement. Distant yells follow, as do the sounds of drawn bronze and iron.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You return his gaze, refusing to back down from the unvoiced challenge. An insistent breeze blows past your eyes, taunting you to give them rest. Within a minute, you become acutely aware of how intensely your body wishes to blink. The Tidecaster continues to meet your glare, somehow looking even angrier than before. Another minute passes.

      <DefaultText>You refocus your efforts, concentrating more on the other muscles on your face.

Eisley, a woman whose life is already marred by the tragedy of wedlock to Jaspos was the last person healed by Reef-Talon.
