      <DefaultText>"You're amongst the Sleepless. I still know that much." He offers a brief, mirthless chuckle. "Soon, I'll be like her... too tired to ever remember who I am. Who you are, either."

His eyes glaze over as he speaks and he drops to a knee. "Not yet. Not yet!" With a shake of his head, he staggers back to his feet. "All she... we... want is to find the Beastwoman that did this. It hurts to be too far from her..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He frowns, pulling the stone closer to his chest. "Its light is all we can feel now. You don't know what it means to face this numbness!" His eyes moisten and a single tear streaks down his cheek.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He glances at you, then at the crystal, then to you again. "Perhaps that's best." He reluctantly drops the stone into your hands. "It feels like a lifetime since we've seen Reef-Talon. Please, find her - this emptiness is somehow more bearable when she's near. I... I just hope I remember to follow you." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"She might want that." He glances at the disheveled woman, a pained expression upon his face. "I... I can't decide that for her. She still lives. We still live, I think." He pushes the torchkey into your arms. "Take it and leave us. I'd sooner be haunted by the Bane than the living."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His face twists into a smile as he drops to his knees. As promised, you kill him swiftly.

The woman beside him reaches out to you and grabs your arm, quietly pleading for mercy. You grant it, in a manner, releasing her from this half-life.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Lyca, can you hear me? Has your mind wandered again?" A haggard-looking man pleads with the emaciated woman resting against the ground. Her shaky head moves in the general direction of his voice. She mouths a reply and reaches toward a glowing crystal in his hands, but no air escapes her lips.</DefaultText>
