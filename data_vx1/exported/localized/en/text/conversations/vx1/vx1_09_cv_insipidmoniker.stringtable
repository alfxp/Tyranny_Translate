      <DefaultText>"Welcome to our little refuge, Fatebinder. You here to help us keep the Wound clear of Bane?" Insipid Moniker picks at a splotch of dried blood on her greaves. She wears the patchwork armor of a Scarlet Fury.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Welcome to our headache. The way the Bane come and go, you'd think the teleporters were beaded curtains."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>13</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That goes deeper into the untamed Oldwalls. We send patrols out to sharpen the Beasts' claws and lighten the numbers of Bane, but we haven't exactly mapped it."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Wagstaff needs Beastmen blood. Lots of it. You think these tainted waters cleanse themselves?

"He said we'd die without it, and I intend to deliver." She wipes her stained hands with a grubby rag.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This settlement would have run its course without me. No shame in taking a little pride in one's duty." She narrows her eyes, challenging you to claim otherwise.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Reef-Talon used to heal her 'kith' after they donated, so they could give more at a time. Pretty much all she was good for."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"After she left, our Beastmen couldn't donate as much without getting too weak to hunt. Our reserves ran low, and Wagstaff needed more. That's where I came in."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We don't kill any of the creatures, and gather only enough blood to keep the settlement going. I'd call that restraint on my part."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Exactly. Fucker iced half my gang with his spells, so now I fight for him. Those are the rules."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>30</ID>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Whatever Wagstaff wants. Guess you can call me an apprentice. I can read, which is more than most can say." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"How'd you get that name?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Figured it was smarter to ask the Voices for a name rather than let my gang boss do it. I figured wrong."</DefaultText>

      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's more... subtle than the red work of the Chorus, but I don't mind a change of pace." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Just like the old times, boys! Whoever kills the Fatebinder gets a week of my water rations." Drawing a blade from her belt, Insipid Moniker rushes at you with a feral cry.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Explain why I should allow this."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I didn't build the ship, and I sure as fuck didn't choose to board her. But I'm here now, and I'm keeping her afloat, which is more than most can say."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Whether or not this is right, this is necessary for Bastard's Wound. I'll permit it."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Huh. More level-headed than I expected from a lawbringer. Now, if you don't mind, the work never ends around here." She winks at you.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I don't want to kill you, but I can't let this atrocity continue."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Make your choice, Fatebinder. We've already made ours." She rests her hands upon her belt, mere inches from her weapons. </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>The fetid stenches of blood and feces assault you as you step into the chamber. Excitement in her eyes, Insipid Moniker struts around the blood-caked room, issuing commands energetically. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No dancing around it - someone's going to suffer. Only a question of whether it's men and women or Beasts. No need for everyone to go down with the ship." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yeah, I've got it. The rock's been entrusted to me for safekeeping. Why should I let some outsider take it off my hands?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Because you'll be deprived of those hands if you don't give it up."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't have time for this. I have important business in the Oldwalls on behalf of your settlement."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Sorry, but I'm not letting any of Jaspos' supporters borrow this keystone. Last thing we need is it getting lost... or added to a fucking bridge."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Right, of course. Don't let this peon delay you any further." Her smirk vanishes as she unwraps the keystone and pushes it forcefully into your hands.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Compelling point. Of all the things to die over, this isn't it." She unwraps a keystone and hands it over to you with a sneer. </DefaultText>

      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Lucky for us, the Beasts seem to love killing Bane. They'll put in more hours on sentry duty than any human, and I welcome the extra sleep."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>66</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ha!" Verse belts abruptly before clapping a hand over her mouth and swallowing further chuckles. "Somebody made the mistake of asking the Voices for a nickname, didn't she?" She snickers as she shakes her head.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>67</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Oh you poor, pathetic fool. You actually ASKED THE VOICES for a nickname? You know the Archon's an artist of suffering, don't you?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Funny story, that." She frowns. "There's a piece of advice they should give every new Chorus conscript, but don't."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>71</ID>
      <DefaultText>"In a twisted way, I think the Voices would approve. Not that his approval is any safer than his wrath." </DefaultText>

      <ID>76</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No, no, no. Don't keep cutting that mongrel at the same spot! The scars will get knotted and tough, and we'll lose a bleeding site. Put the bucket by his ribs and slice horizontally."

She turns to you with momentary disbelief.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>78</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I could have been 'Shits For Days' or 'Bleeding Sores' if I'd waited long enough. Even 'Hindsight' would be more appropriate."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>80</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Look, just keep quiet and you can have the damn keystone. It's not like I was really going to keep a Fatebinder from going into the Oldwalls." She unwraps the cold rock and places it in your hands.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Since you're helping me out, least I can do is scratch your back. I found this keystone and don't quite know where it goes but... I'll leave that to you." With a wry smile, she tosses a familiar keystone your way.</DefaultText>
