      <DefaultText>The [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] apprentice stares intently at the amber hide he holds aloft, pounding its surface methodically with a heavy, iron mace. The light from the nearby hearth dances across his eyes. As you draw closer, the pungent odors of tanning agents thickens in the air.

He turns to you wearing a stoic expression. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Difficult. Don't mistake me - I  pledged to follow him, and my loyalty doesn't waver, but I damn well wish we just returned to the North as planned. Instead, I'm stuck inside these Oldwalls, surrounded by Bane and branded as a traitor in [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' eyes."

      <DefaultText>"Jaspos didn't like my interest in leather working. I think he saw it as an insult to his craft. If I favored it so much, I should have sought apprenticeship with the Master of Tanning, right? Well, consider that ANOTHER thing I planned to do had we returned North."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But with Reef-Talon gone, our hunters can't donate anymore. Jaspos told me that I had to find a way to gather Beastmen bones, or we'd all die. I... didn't have a choice."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Beastmen always eat their fallen and leave the hide and bones behind. All I needed to do was separate and kill an injured Beastmen out on a hunt, and let the others consume the evidence. I thought it was the best route among shit routes."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I wouldn't have done it if I thought otherwise.

      <DefaultText>"Mell is the one being reckless here. He only cares about rings. If you can get him off my back, that'll mean I can go back to only killing old or weakened Woundkin. We need the strong ones to stay safe from the Bane."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Truth is, people need my skill with hides and pelts far more than my attempts at knapping.

      <DefaultText>"I'm not running, but I'm not going to give myself up to an angry mob. I'll head to the Oldwalls and wait for news from you. After you've talked to Mell, come find me.

      <DefaultText>"Thanks for bringing some clarity to this. Jaspos will have to find another way to get his Beastman bones. It sure as [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] won't be from me." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If a Fatebinder thinks our miserable lives worth preserving, then I'll just have to accept it. You've eased my burdens more than you can know. It'll, uh... it'll make the next time easier." He gives you a grateful nod before slinking back into the shadows.</DefaultText>

      <ID>73</ID>
      <DefaultText>"When Reef-Talon was still here, Woundkin could donate teeth and talon and she'd use her magic to make sure they regrew. Between that and Beastmen sometimes dying on the hunt, we had enough bone to keep the sieves flowing all day."</DefaultText>

      <ID>74</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Mell caught me returning with hide and bone at an odd hour. Sussed it out before I could think of an excuse, and forced me to give him advance word of any killings for his little gambling operation."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>75</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No. No, no, no. Mell's a crafty one. He's held the murders over my head ever since he found out. Threatened to reveal what I done to everyone! He'll have half the Wound up in arms over me."

Tonves moves quickly through the Forge, grabbing tools and weapons from nearby racks and tables.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Do it, Fatebinder. If these are my last breaths, I'd like to spend them believing there's some justice in Terratus." His face a stoic mask of cold resignation, he kneels over the dead Beastwoman and gives you an imploring stare.</DefaultText>
