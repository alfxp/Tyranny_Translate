      <DefaultText>Seeing you approaching, he straightens up to seem a little taller. "Wasn't expecting to see a Fatebinder down here. Name's Kleitos, protector of the farm." He announces it like a title. "You may have heard of me." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Surprised ya haven't heard of us. We're the best bloody mercenary company out of the Free Cities, and don't let those motherless Freeblade Maurauders tell ya different. We're the only crew to have bested those Stalwart bastards, not that they'd ever admit it." A sour expression briefly mars his features.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You've unfettered access to the water and the crop, ample opportunity to perform the crime, and have harmed the crop in the past. I'm feeling pretty convinced you're guilty."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Th-the Archon of Shadows?" He searches your pitiless expression. "By the Brothers, ya would, wouldn't ya? Ya'd send [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] for a man!" He swallows, shuddering. "Please don't! I'll do anything! I... I'll confess."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Look Fatebinder." He lowers his usually booming voice. "This thing between the Tidecaster and the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url]? It's tearing the Wound apart. More'n just the crack down the middle of it, I mean. It's getting to where neighbors cross the, well not the road, exactly, but what passes for a road down here, just to avoid talking to ya."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Now ya see that's where's Master Jaspos' brilliance shines! He gave me... something... to mix into the water to make it look different. Don't see how knowing that'll do ya much good, though, seeing as there's none left, and without that, there's, ah, no proving anything."</DefaultText>

      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I hadn't given it much thought..." He frowns and falls into silence, apparently rectifying that oversight. Then he shakes his head roughly. "No, Master Jaspos wouldn't do lasting harm to the Wound. He knows what's best, so I trust his plan, even if I lack its every particular."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Stopped already, actually. Used the last of what Master Jaspos gave me just this morning. Can hardly hurt the mushrooms without that, can I?" He smirks.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The color drains from his face. "Didn't mean anything by it, Fatebinder. I just wanted to help Jaspos keep the Wound safe. Better than safe - great, even! I figured once enough people turned their backs on Wagstaff, he'd ask me to stop and everything'd shake out fine."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He whimpers, squirming at the end of your grip. "Ah-a-ah of course, Fatebinder, anything ya ask, Fatebinder, praise [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url], and [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url]! Ah!"

You let him loose, and he staggers away, cupping himself in pain.

      <DefaultText>"Tycho has me looking after the mushrooms. She keeps a close eye on everything around here - bit too close if you ask me, and she's quick to remind me when I cock something up. Used the wrong water on the mushrooms ONCE, and she up and decked me."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"So I figure best way to keep things from getting too bloody is to sway people to Jaspos' side quick and early. I ask him what I can do for him, and he has me wet the mushrooms with his stuff instead of Wagstaff's magic water. Way he sees it, if everyone thinks Wagstaff cocked up the one thing he's good for, then bam, Jaspos wins by default."</DefaultText>

      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>He blinks, as if that possibility only just occurred to him. "No! Please don't tell them! Tycho will do me far worse than a black eye if she finds out about this. I won't use the wrong water anymore, I swear I won't! Please, please, please don't tell Tycho."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's a uh, matter of Sunder pride. The city fought a bloody war for independence and the terms of the treaty gave Sunder its independence from Stalwart in return for the public declaration that Stalwart did not lose... so much as neither side won.

      <DefaultText>His eyes widen. "Ah, that would be kind of ya, but that would, ah, that would leave the farm under-guarded. Maybe if it gets too bad down there, sure, but the Beastmen seem to have it handled. Claw for claw." He swallows.</DefaultText>
