      <DefaultText>Reef-Talon stands in solemn silence, observing the paint-stained wall with an intensity normally reserved for potential prey. Nearby, Lexeme scribbles furiously with pen and parchment in hand, shaking her head occasionally to maintain her waning focus. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] ceases her scribbling. "Reef-Talon may sadly be right." Her tone grows increasingly bitter as she speaks. "Her touch did, of course, strip me of all magical facility, and the Bane notoriously fiend for all things magic. Who is to say that his mural isn't a damning testimonial about her kind and their role in the birth of these abominations?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The colorful twirls pouring from the Beastwoman's wound seem a bit too stylized to be simply blood and viscera, and details such as eyes and talons on the twirls suggest the spirals of color are Bane. Whether the Beastwoman is ripping herself open or the Bane are exploding out from within her seems open to interpretation.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Several Beastmen have been arranged in a line, heads bent at a downward angle, crouched low on all fours. Compared to the Beastwoman featured prominently in the painting, the remaining figures have been drawn in far less detail - their facial features have been left entirely blank, complicating their interpretation.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It looks as if the Beastwoman is releasing the Bane." She leafs through a journal and pauses momentarily upon a passage. "I thought this seemed oddly familiar. Did you know that Beastmen are in the habit of consuming friends and foes alike upon death? Not that there's much left of Bane after a fight, granted, but I have observed Woundkin occasionally lapping up Scourge essence. Judging by their facial expressions, it was a decision often regretted."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hmm. I can't say this image recalls anything I've seen of the Woundkin, or any records I've come across on the subject. Beastmen do tend to go down fighting - self-destruction is deeply frowned upon in their kind."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A contemplative hum emanates from her chest. "What Fatebinder says is possible. Painted Beastwoman stands before others like [url=glossary:prima]Prima[/url] of tribe. Powerful.

      <DefaultText>You brush a layer of accumulated dust from the wall to better observe this section. The creatures emerging from the Beastwoman's ribcage appear to be flying out and away, in a range of directions. Streaks of purple, blue and red paint have been used to form wispy tendrils, with hints of claws embedded in the amorphous shapes. Upon closer examination, the claws appear to be broken.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I thought I was just sleep deprived but, I recall seeing some prints that were burned into the wall without pigment or paint.

      <DefaultText>"Look." Reef-Talon raises a foot and spreads her toes apart, revealing the thick webbing between them. "All Beastmen know that each tribe has different traits to help claim chosen lands. Shadowhunter clan has fur as dark as midnight. Good for slinking and cowardly battle. Mantaborn have webs in toes for swift deep-sea hunt." She raises her hands, pads facing up. "Perhaps power of mending-rites came to help Woundkin tame Oldwalls beasts."</DefaultText>

Reef-Talon turns her attention to the Beastman and Bane immortalized on the wall before you. "But what has Fatebinder to say of Beastwoman giving birth to Scourge-beasts? Reef-Talon only sees creation of dark horror."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She listens in silence, still save for the flicker of green flame in her eyes. Slowly, she bobs her head in agreement. "Beastwoman saw ancient painting and did not have hope. Believed that Sleepless corruption was sign of own darkness. But humans have offered new insight. Reef-Talon does not believe that mending-rites can be perfected but... must try, for Wound clan."
