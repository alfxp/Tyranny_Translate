      <DefaultText>Dear Fatebinder [Player Name],

May this missive find you in able health. I write to you in hopes of striking a bargain with the Court.

By the laws of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], I am a purveyor of lies. In my work for the School of Ink and Quill, I have written many texts, and while some of the particulars are at odds with history as taught by those loyal to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], I truly believe that our work is not blasphemous, nor treasonous, and does nothing but exemplify the inevitability of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url].

It is not my place to say what is and isn't worthy of censor, that duty, if I understand correctly, is yours.

My offer is this: If you would preserve my texts, I would submit my neck to any sentence you deem worthy without protest. My life is worth little compared to the texts that required the life's work of countless Sages. I understand such writings will likely need to be kept in a vault far from offending eyes... but if I can be assured our written echoes will live on, my flesh and blood are the Court's to discard.

If you are amenable to my offer, seek me out. My current whereabouts are far from the ruins of the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url] - see the reverse of this parchment for instructions. If you make your way to the location directed, I will seek you out.

Glory to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]!

-[url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] L

[On the reverse of this missive is a charcoal sketch of what appears to be a small keep built alongside mountain foothills. A map of the Tiers is drawn in the corner, with a circle that seems to indicate this location is in the Bastard Tier - north and east of the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url].]</DefaultText>

Plan for my arrival, and be prepared to face judgment.

      <DefaultText>Dear [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] L,

Your request is a bit unorthodox. If you are aware of your role in creating forbidden lore, surely you must know that asking me to harbor such things is asking me to take your crime upon myself.

But I am not without reason or mercy, and I will at least hear out all that you have to say in person.

      <DefaultText>Dear Lord or Lady L,

If you were sincere in your desire to surrender to the Court, you are welcome to visit [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url], Archon of Justice, and seek audience with him at the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url]. I assure you, the Archon sleeps very little, and time will be made for a proper hearing.

Beggars cannot be choosers, and the guilty ought not to bargain when their only currency is guilt. Perhaps if you could provide me some more insight to your situation, I'd be less inclined to assume this is some sort of trap.

      <DefaultText>Dear '[url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] L,'

One does not haggle with the law. If you are a peddler of falsehood, you will perish, and your written lies will follow.
