      <DefaultText>"What happened?" Ragwort rushes over and flips Callia on to her back, revealing the bloody bandages covering her former leader's ribs. "Motherless whore, she's really dead." She directs a suspicious glare in your direction.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Old Crassy was a tough bitch. Getting her to admit to any wounds was like pulling teeth. These fucking Sages DID get in a lucky slash with her. If only she let me know how bad it was, I could have stitched her up..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Shit, what?" She jams her fingers into her mouth and issues forth an ear-piercing whistle. Aggressive cries from her comrades come swiftly. "Can't let that one slide, Fatebinder."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Callia's dead, we're officially done with this ash heap. Grab your gear, leave the sages, we're moving out." She gives Callia's corpse a frown before turning to leave. "Now to solve Skinner and the gang's mine. Thanks Fatebinder."</DefaultText>
