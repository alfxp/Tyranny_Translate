      <DefaultText>He inhales, ready to speak, but can't find the words. The upturned corners of his mouth still resemble a smile, but his eyes convey something else entirely. "You're the boss, Fatebinder. Not a fight I'm going to even try to win. One of these bottom-feeders will probably shiv me in my sleep after finding out. That'll be interesting."
