      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder! Good day to you." The young man greets you with a smile as distant shouts reverberate throughout the area, steadily growing in volume. "As you might have observed, your presence comes as a bit of a surprise. It's an unexpected pleasure, I mean, to receive an esteemed servant of the Court." He bows stiffly, revealing a row of multi-shaped quills along his back.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This place was discovered three years ago, by braver and more adventurous souls than Master Lexeme and I - we're relative newcomers, going on about a year at this point. When [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] smashed Rostrom Vorus' Manor, his supporters fled into the cracked mountainside and discovered this place. At the time, life here with the Bane sounded better than life at war with the Archons. From there, the settlement grew in spurts. We are far off the beaten path, so visitors are rare but the few we've gotten have often made this place home."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Tidecaster Wagstaff, devised a method to magically treat the water, rendering it safe to consume, and with curative properties for those already sick. This solution is a bit slow at making large amounts, but fortunately Jaspos constructed some stone aquifers. Water poured into these aquifers will drain a few hours later and emerge purified. Between their contributions, we're able to make the Wound a proper home... so long as the two keep their squabbling to a minimum."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They've been perfectly eager to dig their claws into any that come our way - it's surprising that even works, by the way, but who am I to argue? At any rate, they keep the entry points to the Wound clear, and seem content to keep doing so. In fact... I daresay some of them have come to love hunting the Bane... or just have a death wish and that's why they volunteer for patrol day after day."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There was also a Beastwoman, Reef-Talon - really quite a remarkable creature, actually - she held this place together and kept tempers at bay until fairly recently. She was as worthy a leader as we've seen in the Wound... but she's no longer with us. So the bickering between Jaspos and Wagstaff continues."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He chuckles, his lips pressed together in a slight, knowing smile. "Prickly old fellow, Wagstaff. One of the last Tidecasters in the Tiers, I believe." His eyes widen in sudden realization. "His kind were enemies to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], true, but I'm certain he has no personal designs against the Overlord, Fatebinder."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Reef-Talon was our bulwark against not only the Bane, but death itself. She had a mystic gift, or so we thought. Her touch brought everyone - the wounded, the sick, the dying - back from the edge, but it changed them. The curse wasn't noticeable at first, but seemingly without fail, those healed would slowly but surely stop sleeping."</DefaultText>

But before making a, perhaps, official proclamation, I urge you to walk the settlement and see for yourself. The situation is complicated, and I fear that most here would balk at such an order."</DefaultText>

He taps a long quill against his thigh, its feather plume fluttering nervously in return. "I figure if that was the case, I'd be waist-deep in lava as we speak."

      <DefaultText>"We get enough sunlight to cultivate crops on the upper levels - cabbage, gnashroot, radishes. Mushrooms, even. The biggest challenge here is drinking water, despite appearances." He leans forward while speaking, his tone energetic. "It's a rather interesting phenomenon, actually. Something in the Oldwalls environment leeches into the water and corrupts it, producing a most curious disease in the afflicted. There's no fever or chills, bleeding, vomiting or what have you, but you will waste away over time, as if one were starving."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He nods, absentmindedly rubbing the dried ink between his fingers. "Yes, of course, but we have a system for that. You've met our greeting party in the caves, I take it? Incidentally, what happened to-" He shakes his head, dismissing the thought. "It doesn't matter. The point is that we have a contingent of Beastmen with us, and they've adapted exceedingly well to the Oldwalls and show little fear of the abominations."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Few things that matter. I do not mean to belittle those men, but I often feel like they both demand exaltation and more importantly, want whatever adoration someone else is getting." He clears his throat, turning red with a smile. "Through their magic, they make life possible here, and we all look up to them. I think they both feel a genuine sense of duty to protect us all... too bad they don't get along despite this shared goal."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Remarkable place, is it not?" He stretches his arms apart, looking around for emphasis. "We've no idea how old this corner of the Oldwalls happens to be, but the tunnel leading into it came into being a few years ago. [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]'s fury was unleashed in a battle on the topside, and whatever powers he used split under the mountains and fractured these Oldwalls."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Master Lexeme is sadly not amongst us. She vanished into the lower levels some time ago. She wasn't herself..." He furrows his brow, visibly distressed.

      <DefaultText>"Unfortunately, that's a matter of debate at the moment. For a while, two men in particular led this settlement - Tidecaster Wagstaff, who has been here the longest, and [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] Master Jaspos. They made it possible to survive here but rarely see things eye-to-eye. Were the conditions here not so fragile, I'm certain they would have come to blows ages ago."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Jaspos and his two apprentices arrived some time after Wagstaff. I think we worried he'd be a true loyalist and demand we surrender to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], but he's taken a shine to this place and is trying to create his own little corner of Terratus. I think he likes the seclusion and being surrounded by a variety of rock types. He built most of the bridges you see here, some cisterns to filter water - he's a one-man work crew... and he knows it, unfortunately."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He's not one for pleasantries or... charisma of any sort, but he is a master of his craft. He was the first to treat the toxic waters in these Oldwalls, and to date, it's the only cure that works. The Wound would be in bad shape without him."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A minor malady at first, but a cumulative one. As days and weeks go on, they lose themselves. Depression, malaise, paranoia, unending unto itself. My Master Lexeme was treated by Reef-Talon, and in her case, she lost her ability to work magic. Between this and some disputes about whether it's proper for a Beastwoman to lead humans resulted in a Reef-Talon leaving the Wound, disappearing into the depths of the Oldwalls. Many of the Sleepless followed."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ah, of-of course, I can see why things might appear that way." He stammers, running his hands clumsily over the scrolls along his bandolier. He snatches one from its loop and taps at it nervously. "If you look at this drawing of the area, we are, by way of several fathoms, below the Oldwalls you see rising up. So who's to say if we're in the walls or really just underground."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He stares at you, dumbfounded. "I, uh..." He backs away, dropping his quill. 

Several other men and women watch from the upper levels, gasping and muttering to one another. One of them draws a weapon, followed by another, and then another. Calls echo out across the chamber, quickly growing in intensity.

"If we must do this, Fatebinder, then... then so be it!" The scribe gestures for others to join him and turns to face you, ready.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You look past the scribe, taking note of the details in this cavernous area. Giant stone walls flank the space and ascend to an open sky, seemingly shorn apart from one another. Thunderous waterfalls cascade down, nearly ringing the stone-tiled islands that comprise the settlement.

"Oh, you mean right now? Well, I can certainly provide a modest contribution." He rifles through his pouches, clumsily searching for a suitable offering. "We don't use rings as often as we did on the surface, so it may take me a moment." He loosens a pouch and jams his hand inside. "A-ha! Here you are, Fatebinder."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I regret not being a better student of Beastman magics, but I concur - this is most unusual. What's stranger still, Reef-Talon did not boast about being a mystic... and beasts are nothing if not boastful. I have a hypothesis, perhaps she slew so many Bane their sickly powers have soaked into her very touch." He shrugs, letting out a long sigh. "But it's just speculation... all I know for sure is scores of lives were inadvertently ruined by her 'healing gift' and folks here have some complicated feelings toward Reef-Talon."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He pauses in thought, nervously rolling a quill between his fingers. "None have recovered, unfortunately. The end result appears to be inevitable. Still, I can't help but wonder if Reef-Talon could have corrected this. It's a shame. You should know, Fatebinder, that there are a small number of people that have been treated by Reef-Talon but haven't fully lost their grip on things. Jaspos's apprentice, Eisley, for one.

      <DefaultText>"I saw him returning from the Oldwalls late one night with Beastman blood staining his smock and weapons. He was careful to avoid the Handlers, but didn't catch me observing him.
