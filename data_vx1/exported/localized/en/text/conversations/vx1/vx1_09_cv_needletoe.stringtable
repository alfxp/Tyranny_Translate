      <DefaultText>"Me? I'm the eyes and ears - been pulling scout duty since we lost Shrill Tantrum to the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]. When I'm not watching over the gang, I'm watching over this one." He points to the woman standing near him.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I never wanted any part of it. Most of what you see is all fun and games, but if you've got an issue, talk to Skinner about it. He's the one watching over us 'worms' anyway."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You see Needle Toe standing amidst a mass of corpses, out of breath, deep bags set beneath his eyes. Phoibe and a couple wide-eyed Sages take in the scene while Contusion stands nearby, scratching her head in confusion.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You bastard." He shakes his head, tears beginning to form in the corners of his eyes. "I won't let you..."
	
He draws a confused Contusion in his arms, kissing her softly while stroking her cheek. Her blissful smile is interrupted by a short, pained gasp. Needle Toe withdraws a knife from her chest and lowers her to the ground, gently. "I'll be damned if I let you walk over us without a fight, Fatebinder." He twists around and releases the dagger in one smooth motion, sending it directly into Phoibe's chest. With a gasp, she collapses upon the ground, unmoving.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Thank you, Fatebinder, truly. I don't know if you did this out of kindness or whatever, but I'll remember this day." He grabs Contusion's hand and points towards the dusty horizon. "This way, girl. I know the way."

She nods, a trusting smile on her face, and sets off with her husband.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Hush, they're just sleeping... you didn't do anything wrong. It's time for us to go." He turns to you, pointing a shaky hand at the corpses around you. "It's done, like you asked. We're free to go, right?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fuck you, fuck the Archons, and fuck [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]." Before you can reach him, Needle Toe grabs a nearby sword and falls upon it, slumping to the ground next to his dead wife with a groan.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'd be lying if I didn't tell you I've contemplated running every day. When Contusion got her injury, things got all the more terrifying. Crass Callia sees her as a simpleton best suited for arrow-bait."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What? That's mad... I can't do that. We aren't exactly chums, but we've fought and ranged for months. They don't deserve that." He gulps, eying you nervously. "But... if you'll swear Contusion are free to go afterward..."</DefaultText>
