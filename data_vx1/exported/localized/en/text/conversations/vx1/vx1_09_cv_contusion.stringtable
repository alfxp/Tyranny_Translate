      <DefaultText>A tall, wiry woman peers intently at scrap of parchment in her hand, tracing the contours of an elaborate drawing with her finger. "Like tree, but prettier." She giggles approvingly at its contents, scratching the area around a noticeable dent in her forehead. As you approach, she crumples up the drawing and stuffs it in her shirt. "Are you friend?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She taps at her forehead, a confused expression spreads across her face as she hunts around for something on her face, oblivious to the injury. "What do you mean? Did I make a mess again?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Pretty drawing. Skinner plays with Sages and said [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] so happy she gave drawing as gift."
 
She holds out the wrinkled parchment, which contains a prominent sigil and many paragraphs of scholarly exposition.</DefaultText>

      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You make nice drawing for me?"

You produce a pen and clean parchment. As she hands you the scroll, you copy its sigil precisely, adding minor embellishments to exaggerate its features. Contusion claps excitedly as you add the flourishes.

As she gazes adoringly at her new gift, you tuck the now-unwanted scroll away in your pack.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Evil spell?" Her face crinkles up and she begins to pant rapidly, as if on the verge of tears. "Needle already say I forget things. If evil drawing make me forget Needle, what will I do?" She drops the scroll and kicks it away, and looks relieved when you roll it up and stuff it into your pack.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She cradles the parchment protectively against her chest, profusely shaking her head. "No! Drawing is gift from Skinner." She gives it a quick glance before stuffing it inside her shirt.</DefaultText>
