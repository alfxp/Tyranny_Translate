      <DefaultText>"Good day to you, Fatebinder. Let me be the first to tell you that all of my licenses are well in order, signed and sealed this very year!" He swipes a layer of perspiration from his brow and chuckles nervously. "No reason at all to ransack my cart or confiscate my goods."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ah, what is there to say? Living in the depths of the Oldwalls ain't exactly a wise man's dream, but neither is living under the constant threat of raiders. Least down here my back gets watched by Beasts. Jaspos seems to have a pretty good handle on how things should be done... he's certainly more of a people person than Wagstaff... but that don't mean the Tidecaster's a bad person or nothing."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder [Player Name]. Haven't seen much of you in these parts [url=lore:feedingthehost_bwound]since you gave the Disfavored free reign to sack our caravans[/url]. You're half the reason I ended up down here. Not that I'll hold it against you. I've set up in worse places than the Wound, and there ain't no Chorus gangs here looking to claim my knife and nethers."</DefaultText>
