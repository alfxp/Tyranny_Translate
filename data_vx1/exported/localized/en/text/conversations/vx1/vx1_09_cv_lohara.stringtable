      <DefaultText>"Jaspos? None of us have heard from him in some time. He certainly did his part to create the Forge here, but there's little else for a knapper to do after setting the foundation. I'm quite certain he was ordered to return home." She grabs an iron ingot and holds it aloft. "This, on the other hand, is the vanguard of my our work. My tour of duty ends only when they are no more enemies for my iron to kill."

"So where did Jaspos end up?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She shakes her head, chuckling to herself. "How? A fall? A wolf attack? Doesn't matter, really. No doubt it happened while he was distracted by his own reflection somewhere. That man always was the cleanest worker in the Forge, and I don't mean that as a compliment." 

"He also wouldn't be the first to have 'hardship' delay his journey home. I wish him a speedy recovery."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She scratches her chin, smearing soot across them in short streaks. "Now that's odd. [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] gives us leeway in our duties, but a several-years absence would be frowned upon. That settlement would have to be producing something valuable to excuse his detour. At least I hope so... for his sake." A smile creeps across her face and she offers a half-hearted shrug. "But he's not my ward, and not my concern."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That's your right, Fatebinder. Jaspos is not under my supervision, so I ask only out of curiosity." She scowls. "We're just here to meet the quotas, anyway."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Only the superficials, sadly. He worked in stone, I'm more keen on metal - so we rarely compared notes. I knew he was arrogant! Confident beyond his years and talent. Not to say he was inept, far from it, but a few years of flaking chert does not make one [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' gift to the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I have no idea what inventory the stone smiths kept with them. All of our stone workers left some time ago. A few of them meant to return north by ocean travel, which meant first traveling to the southern coastline. I'd imagine they're probably gone by now but if you need those tools, I can't imagine they had room on the galley to take all their sledge hammers. If I were you, I'd ask around for Cassandra, or - since she's likely on a boat home right now - see if some local was drafted to attend to her or haul her stuff - maybe they inherited some of her excess belongings she couldn't take on the boat."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her eyes widen and she cracks a smile. "So either he's in legal trouble or you're saying you bumped into him at the brothel and are trying to be discreet. Either way, he's not my apprentice, 'tis none of my business."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Once this place was built, most of the knappers were sent home. I know his supervisor was Cassandra, Master of Knapping - she was sent home as well. She's a bit on in years, not quite fit for the long walk back, so I think she's currently enjoying a boat ride home."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Aside from that, I suppose in the abstract, I could have someone cast a few chisels and hammers but... if you are looking for tools made by and for the stone experts, I think South Haven is your best bet short of slogging it back to Fort Resolution."</DefaultText>
