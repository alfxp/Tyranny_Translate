      <DefaultText>The Chorus warrior halts her work of grinding spices with a mortar and pestle as you approach, and the sharp, pungent smells of herbs and oil stand out over the prevailing smell of char in the village.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I've scarcely had words with them, which suits me fine." She jerks her head towards Skinner. "He's our torture enthusiast, maybe speak with him?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Me? I just do what Callia says and try not to get in the way. Since most of these louts can't smell over their own stink, the 'honor' of cooking falls to me." She wipes her nose across her arm before returning to the work of grinding her mortar and pestle.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She chuckles, only stopping when realizing the humor is one-sided. "Oh... yeah, of course. Wouldn't have anything to do with all that! Enough troubles out in the field. If you've seen anything amiss, talk to Skinner. He's Callia's 'second,' after all." She abruptly turns and resumes crushing herbs in a mortar.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Still here? This whole situation's fucked. Once these idiots find out about Callia, it's going to get uncomfortable real quick. Everyone wants to be top dog." She shrugs. "Including me. Anyway, you need something?" </DefaultText>
