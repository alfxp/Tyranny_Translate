      <DefaultText>The brickwork of the Oldwalls is impressively meticulous, leaving little in the way of gaps between each smooth-surfaced block. With some difficulty, you find the outliers in the precise masonry and find your handholds. It takes you a few minutes to slowly work your way up for a better look of the mural.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Now at the top, you can clearly see a large break at the top of the depicted maze. A plethora of the humanoid figures swarm the top, with a few trickling down into the maze below. These humanoid shapes come in a variety of sizes and colors, some noticeably larger than others. The details on these figures are difficult to decipher, though you're able to spot some sharp talons, and a few that appear to have a tail, horns, or some other extra appendage.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Along the lower edge of the mural, on what would amount to the floor or bottom of the maze, you spot traces of faded paint not visible from a distance. Tiny bone-white hashes of skulls and skeletons are intermixed with the masonry of the bottom edge.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The pristine, meticulously-ordered stretch of Oldwalls masonry is dramatically interrupted by an intricate mural, painted across the brick wall with primitive pigments.
