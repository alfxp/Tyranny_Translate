      <DefaultText>A small group of [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] stand in conference around an older, gray-haired woman. Blue tattooed streaks trail down from her hairline, coming to rest upon a pair of eyebrows permanently fixed in a severe expression. She grasps a hunk of jasper and strikes it several times with a sharp piece of obsidian. "The motion should feel rhythmic as you work the stone, as mundane as breath."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She permits a smirk for the briefest of moments. "I've shaved my head for nearly every day of my life... I think I've earned a reprieve." She lightly smacks the back of an apprentice's head as he kneels to work. "These idiots don't get that luxury. We have these traditions for a reason. If you waded into a forge-fire all day, you'd know better than to grow a mop of wicks out of your head."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Jaspos? I thought officers of the Court would be better informed, Fatebinder. There can be only one Master of Knapping at a time. I'm not a corpse yet, despite the wishes of my apprentices, so the title remains with me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Why are we even talking about Jaspos? The only title he's fit to wear is Master of Arrogance. He was a dutiful-enough student, but I've heard the boasts he's made to my apprentices in private. He learned quickly, I'll give him that, but he was a long way off from attaining any kind of mastery."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"As Master of Knapping, it's my duty to build the forges that keep the others occupied. Bronze and iron are the Guild's trademark, but stone's the foundation. When [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' conquest began, my kin followed the armies into the Tiers and I led the efforts to build up [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"With our task at the Crossing complete, there was naught to do after but return home. I barely made the long march south, so I decided to head towards the closest port - just near here - and planned to catch a boat back home. But the journey here was difficult. Brotherhood bandits ambushed us on the road." Her eyes narrow at the memory, and she rubs the left side of her abdomen. "They fancied our forge implements and thought them fair payment for use of the road. I refused, and we brained them with our hammers."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Mother. Fucker." She takes a hammer and smashes it against a nearby wall, sending fragments of it flying. "The gall of that man. I'd cave his head in as an example, were he here." She strikes the wall again for good measure.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What makes you think-" Her eyes widen in recognition. "Oh I get it." She grits her teeth and scowls. "I have a suspicion we're both being used."

"The tools in question are mine - given to me by Forge Master Zdenya years ago in honor of my semicentennial with the Guild."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"After we left [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url], I noticed the set was incomplete - several key hammers and chisels, one of my best loupes - all missing. At the time, I assumed the fault lay with me. The way to South Haven wasn't without its troubles, and I assumed I misplaced things during the shuffle. I would never have guessed that Jaspos would steal them from me, from his own master!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If my knees were still good for sprinting I'd chase down that ungrateful rake and pulverize his skeleton one bone at a time." Her rage seems to vanish with a shrug and a smile. "And I suppose making tools is what I do best... not like I can't replace what was lost but... those tools were a gift - and not even I can fashion sentimentality out of rock."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Zdenya fashioned them as part of series of works inspired by some pre-war study into the Tidecasters and their ways. She took it upon herself to spend a year working only with the crystals and metals the 'Casters used in their designs. My tools were some of her best pieces that came from that year of experimentation."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"In truth, I can do just fine with 'lesser' tools. As much as I adore the set Zdenya made for me, nobody can make a handle to fit my hand quite like I do." She picks up a small hammer and twirls it in her hand. "But if Jaspos thinks he can claim the rest of my tools and pretend to greatness... that ungrateful wretch is dead to me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She moves in front of a nearby table, shielding the stone implements from view. "No. Fatebinder. You have no claim to these, unless you mean to challenge Zdenya herself." She places her hand upon a large hammer attached to her belt. "I've told you the truth of the matter, and I'll do so again before [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She cracks her neck with a quick tilt of her head. "I cracked a rib or three, and some others in the party were wounded. So resting in South Haven seemed wise. The locals were overly accommodating, and I started wondering if I'd even live through the sea voyage home. So I decided to set up shop and teach here - our temporary stay became rather permanent."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I have chisels older than him - he's far, far too young for such a rank! He of course had potential - I wouldn't instruct anyone who doesn't - but he seeks approval in people, rather than in his own craft. Hardly a master's mindset."</DefaultText>

      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Capteron? Oh, for fuck's sake." She rolls her eyes in a sudden loss of composure. "A love-sick cub if I've ever seen one. He's helpful with hauling and odd jobs, but enough with his endless pining! Not that he's ever experienced love, as best as I can tell. He's well past fathering age, but probably couldn't find a vagina in a brothel."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Thank you, Fatebinder." She visibly relaxes, as do several of her apprentices who quickly return to their duties. "I'm glad we could clear up this misunderstanding, and I'm sorry that one of my own deceived you.

      <DefaultText>Standing before a rapt audience of villagers, Cassandra holds Capteron by rope cords tied around his hands. "People of South Haven, before you stands a criminal, one who will not live by rules of common justice! Capteron, by his own admission, was caught trying to steal tools from our shop. Such acts harm our work, harming the prosperity of all. Capteron is a grown adult, yet in all his years he has not learned how to live with others. To halt his larceny, and to warn others who might contemplate acting in his example, Capteron must die."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His face a pitiful mess of tears and dribbling mucus, Capteron gasps and heaves, barely able to blubber out a plea. "Please! I care for you! Believe me. I-I would never do anything to harm you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Quiet!" Cassandra silences the prisoner with a weighty backhand. "Meet your fate with some measure of dignity."

"Fatebinder, I apologize for that. In your experience, I'm sure you know the guilty will say anything to avoid judgment. This affair is hardly worth your time."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her sinewy biceps contract to control the force from each impact, keeping the jasper remarkably still. "Listen to your senses. If the shape in your mind doesn't feel inevitable, then you're wasting your strength AND my time." Noticing your approach, she halts her demonstration and waves off her apprentices.

      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder. I am Cassandra, Master of Knapping. The [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] present are in my charge." She grants you a perfunctory nod.

      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder." She nods out of habit, a poor cover for her contemptuous tone. "I thought our business with you had concluded. All that I helped build at the Crossing lays dormant, thanks to you. You must have come here for a specific purpose, so what is it you want?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder, be on your guard. The Forge was raided last night and my gravelight tools stolen." She scowls, barely able to contain her fury. "Those Brotherhood cowards would do something like this... no doubt to spite me for killing some of their own, years ago! I'll just have to double the watch at night now."</DefaultText>

      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>She palms her face, disgusted by the thought. "That simpleton? Of course not. I'm not here for romance, and certainly not with the village idiot." She releases a long sigh. "I am, however, perfectly willing and able to kill one's affections. It usually doesn't take more than a few conversations. Next time I see Capteron blubbering nearby... maybe I'll have a chat with him."</DefaultText>

      <ID>55</ID>
      <DefaultText>She grimaces, but nods in response. "This isn't how I want to spend my time, but I'll admit that his pining is painful to watch. Despite appearances, I'm not a cruel person. I'll make things clear for him."</DefaultText>

      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That is absurd. I have skills to impart upon a new generation and this simpleton's affections aren't my concern. I won't deny that he tries to be helpful. If... allowing him a few more tasks and giving him a kind word on occasion will help, then so be it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If this is true, someone must be informed about-" she halts her thought a clenched fist. "If it's true that Jaspos is claiming such things, know that it is a punishable offense in the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] Guild.

"If this is YOUR Guild then I guess you can strip YOUR Master of her tools - maybe you'd also enjoy shitting in your own stew."
