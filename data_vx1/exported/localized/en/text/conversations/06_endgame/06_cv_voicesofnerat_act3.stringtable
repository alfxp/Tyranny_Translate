      <DefaultText>"I'm saying that he pointed us at Krokus, he led us to Fort Squander, and that he wanted me to learn what I learned there." She counts her points off on her fingers.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Invite her into our cacophonous whole, of course." The Archon of Secrets touches his mask, then runs a hand down the front of the ragged robes that serve him as a chest. "Worry not for her, for we shall envelop her in familial understanding. Your sacrifice to our holy cacophony." The Archon's words pile atop one another, teetering on the brink of collapse into meaninglessness. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I've never seen the Voices get like this... it's like he's fractured around the edges. I know it sounds crazy, but if you gave him what he wanted, I'll bet he couldn't take it." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Look at us, Binder, and the path we took to get here. It hardly seems a path at all. More like some kind of improvised mummers' farce in a drunkard's dream. With worse dialog." She barks out a laugh. "It's probably that way for everyone who hasn't lived for half a fucking millennium."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This isn't how I pictured shit playing out, but it damn well should have been." She taps the side of her head as she takes a hesitant step towards [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url]. "The hate I've got howling in here's going to swallow you whole before you get the chance to choke on it." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"As tempting as we find the thought of inviting another of Ashe's iron-skulled sycophants into our membership, we prepared our dear Verse for this moment. We have made of the girl a unique vintage, and we shall accept no other in her stead."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Help you lead-?" She chuckles, her bronze head rotating slowly back and forth. "Fatebinder. You've got my service, you've got my blade, and you always will. But the Chorus is that blade now. MY blade, won by right of the challenge I mounted against him." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We gave your sisterhood the opportunity to scream your song, little raven, to call down the very stars with your dance. We furnished both stage and audience! You blame us for the performance, but was not the misstep yours?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>422</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You're right. Their deaths... that's on me, too. On us both." She raps a closed fist against her sternum. "I survived, like I always have, and I committed myself to the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url]. To you, Archon of Secrets... and to myself." The Fury takes a single hesitant step towards [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url]. "Of course we'd come together here at the end." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Age has a way of broadening one's perspectives, little Fury, until the chaos resolves into patterns and the patterns shatter into chaos." He twirls his scepter, trailing a web of luminous green wisps.  "We're all spiders, my lovely, horrid little spy!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh no, our dear, ridiculous Fatebinder, no, not at all. But we shall rescind our territorial claims and remove our Chorus from the Tiers, leaving the particulars of this peninsula's governance to those remaining. The Tiers will be entirely below our notice."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I think... I think I hear my sisters in here." She touches her new bronze head, running her fingertips along its unfamiliar contours. "Maybe this... maybe it's some kind of reunion. Not what I'd have asked for, sure, but... maybe it's not all shit, either."</DefaultText>
