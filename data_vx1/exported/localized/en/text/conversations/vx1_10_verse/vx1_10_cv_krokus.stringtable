      <DefaultText>He stumbles to his feet, one arm clamped over his ribs. Without looking up, he ambles toward the small campsite, sweeping up his pack and slinging it over one shoulder.

      <DefaultText>"I never actually saw him EAT someone, but I'm sure he did. You could see it in his eyes when he looked at you, that hunger. He was a [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url], so maybe that explains it. Overlord knows what those scrollfuckers do in their libraries."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Part of it was the gambling. People would stop taking her bets after a day or two. The first time she says she can put a javelin in an apple at a hundred yards, a man puts rings down. The second time he's willing to go double or nothing. The third?
