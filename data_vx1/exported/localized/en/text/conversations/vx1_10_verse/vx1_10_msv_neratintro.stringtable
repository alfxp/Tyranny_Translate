      <DefaultText>Our favorite Fatebinder!

We hope this finds you victoriously blood-soaked, thoroughly trembling, and spent in glorious conquest against our many enemies - shared and otherwise!

Do you enjoy the company of our little Verse? Her dance never fails to inspire in us the most pleasant quivers. We have a gift for her, delivered through you due to the girl's questionable faculty with letters. We've learned from one of our birds that a mercenary in Haven has been absolutely gloating about slaying her sisters. His boasts even secured him work defending some Crossing merchant.

Show her the sigils on the reverse. She'll know what they mean.

      <DefaultText>Dearest Fatebinder, Champion of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s Gavel, Slayer of Choirmen!

We hope you recognize that we bear you no ill will. Who understands treachery if not the Archon of Secrets? We've always held the very highest esteem for the work of other specialists in the arts duplicitous. Make no mistake, dear Fatebinder - after your little performance at [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url], and with such a flair for theatrical illumination, you have ascended in our estimate! We trust you will understand that when we peel the flesh from your bones and squeeze the bile from your quivering innards, it's strictly out of artistic integrity and the courtesy owed a fellow professional. 

Nothing personal at all.

But enough about our friendly rivalry. Do you enjoy the company of our little spy? Her dance never fails to inspire in us the most pleasant quivers. We have a gift for her, delivered through you due to the girl's questionable faculty with letters. We've learned from one of our birds that a mercenary in Haven has been absolutely gloating about slaying her sisters. His boasts even secured him work defending some Crossing merchant.

Show her the sigils on the reverse. She'll know what they mean.

      <DefaultText>Archon of Secrets,

Receiving your missive was an unexpected pleasure. I shall see to it that Verse is informed. Doubtless this will end in blood.

      <DefaultText>Archon of Secrets,

No doubt you intend your message to elicit violence and chaos. That's standard for you, however, so I'm left to wonder: what else do you hope to accomplish?

      <DefaultText>Nerat,

I don't know yet what you have planned for Verse, but I promise to unravel it. As you watch your little plot collapse upon itself, imagine what I'll do to your grandest designs before I bring my blades to you.

      <DefaultText>Ah, Fatebinder!

You wound us! Have we ever needed an incentive beyond violence and chaos? If we have an ulterior motive, it is merely to see what Verse does with our gift. She is well-practiced in both of those qualities, and we take incredible pleasure in observing her development.

Set aside your paranoia and share in our delight, [Player Name].

      <DefaultText>Dear Fatebinder!

You clearly remain woefully unpracticed at the fine art of setting insults to paper! We shall lock away the page you sent for the day when we require evidence of your impaired judgment and lack of impartiality. Brother [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] should find the revelation intriguing, don't you think?

With indescribable fondness,
