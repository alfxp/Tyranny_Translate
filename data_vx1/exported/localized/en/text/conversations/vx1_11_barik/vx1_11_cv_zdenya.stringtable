      <DefaultText>"Another display of the cleverness [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s clerks are known for. The ruling certainly provided that loophole. A loop enough to make a noose of." There's something sour in her slight smile. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The first step would be an examination. Anyone with a passing understanding of the mystical arts of the forge could handle that. Yet Barik is a unique specimen. Identifying the source of his persistent malady may not reveal a countermeasure."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Have you seen Barik? Imagine living like that, marching in your own filth, yet remaining unfailing loyal to the Archons and Overlord who have imprisoned you. Is this alliance not founded on the principle of forging better ways?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It should not surprise me that you would act so brazenly against your Archon's stated wishes, yet I admit astonishment.

      <DefaultText>"You can leave off your attempt to wring tears from me, Fatebinder... I take your point. Your companion deserves better than the treatment he has had at the hands of the Archons." She exhales a long, halting sigh. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Tiersman? You think you will find a Tiers-born smith capable of understanding the intricacies of Barik's armor, much less freeing him of it?" She laughs.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The articulation necessary to make Barik's armor functional... To imagine such complexity coming into being by chance..." She shakes her head. </DefaultText>
