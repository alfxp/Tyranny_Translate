      <DefaultText>You make out a few figures on the road well ahead of you. The glint of iron and bronze marks them as well-armed and armored. Two feature the broad shoulders of Beastmen haulers and lead a heavily-laden cart. As they near, you realize that the standard flown from their cart boasts the heraldry of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] the Adjudicator, Archon of Justice. They hail you as you approach.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You recognize the woman who leads the procession as a minor functionary in [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s service by the name of Alma. Her clothes bear the red, black, and gold of the Court, and she keeps her light brown hair in a carefully braided bun atop her head. </DefaultText>
