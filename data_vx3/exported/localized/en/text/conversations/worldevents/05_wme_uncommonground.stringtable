      <DefaultText>You hear them before you see them - around a curve of dusty stone ahead, two sets of voices raised against one another. You struggle to make out what they say, but the words reverberate down the ravines and echo along the walls, muddling against themselves. You feel confident that Beastmen comprise one of the groups, humans the other.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you move towards the clamoring groups, one of the Beastwomen falls silent, nose turning upwards. Muscles rippling she turns and glares directly at you, nostrils flaring even as eyes narrow to knife-sharp slits. Fangs appear beneath curled lips. "[url=glossary:prima]Prima[/url] slayer!" she roars, the baritone rattling your ribs. Her packmates turn, and the pack begins to spread around you, stalking towards you.

The Sages glance toward one another, apparently forgotten.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Neither group initially seems to notice your approach. You clear your throat, and one of the Sages glances at you, his eyes widening. He points at you - "Fatebinder! We're here on a mission for the cause! You have to protect us from these savage beasts!"

"Who is savage?" a Beastwoman asks, backhanding the [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] and sending him sprawling to his hands and knees. He stands again, wiping the back of his hand across his mouth and only succeeding in smearing the blood that has appeared there. His eyes meet yours, pleading.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you move closer to the two groups, you make out one of the [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url] barking about lost artifacts and Elder Teeth.

Neither group seems to take notice of you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Pressing against the stone as you make your way silently towards the quarrel, you recognize the harsh and guttural tones of a Beastwoman. She describes a powerful individual, tall and muscle-graced, with iron words and eyes that flash with lightning. It's only when you hear the word '[url=glossary:prima]prima[/url]' that you realize she's describing you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You crest a stone outcropping and peer down on the argument. A small pack of Beastmen shout at a group of Sages, nervous figures in soot-coated clothes, the quills tucked among their persons limp in the heat. The Sages obstruct the distance between the [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url] and a small camp composed of a few ragged tents and several wooden crates.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You round the curl in the stone path and come across a mangy pack of Beastmen, hair matted and reeking, looming over a small group of Sages. The scholars' clothes are filthy with soot and the dust of the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url], and they've put themselves between the angry Beasts and a small encampment consisting of a couple of ragged tents and a few crooked crates.

Neither group seems to take notice of you as you approach.</DefaultText>
