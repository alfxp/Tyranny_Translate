      <DefaultText>As you pick your way through craggy, blasted hills peppered with the charred remnants of trees, the weak breeze carries to your ears distance-muted shouts from somewhere to the east.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You hang back and try to pick out strands of meaning from the chaotic shouts. It quickly becomes clear that the fight is mostly between the Chorus gangleader and her counterpart among the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]: the two are fighting over who gets to take the three Sages custody. The lead [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url], however, interjects half-heartedly to object, claiming that her people won't be taken alive.

You notice the Sages' bags bulge with parchment. Given your proximity to the ruins of the [url=glossary:burning library]Burning Library[/url], there's every possibility these Sages carry arcane writings rescued from the Sages' former stronghold.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You charge down the hill towards the commotion, your boots pounding the stone, your weapons lowered against warriors sporting scarlet and violet alike. With practiced efficiency, the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] raise blades, javelins and shields to meet your charge. The Archon of Secrets' gang leader shouts a command and the Chorusmen draw bronze and wood. "Traitor!" she screams, spittle raining from her lips.

The Sages step back, fingers twisting protective sigils before them.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The conversation gutters as you approach the armed men and women. 
"What the fuck do you want?" the Chorus gang leader growls.

"Fool!" the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] sergeant barks. "This is the [Player Title] of the Mountain Spire." He turns to you, his gauntlet rapping against his breastplate in salute. "Will you settle this, sworn vassal of the Adjudicator?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The fuck is this?" the Chorus gang leader asks, eyes flitting between you and the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]. "Is this your vaunted honor, ironclad? A damned ambush?" She spits on the blasted earth before shouting, "Kill them all!" Bronze weapons ready as the Chorusmen advance on you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Fatebinder?" the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] lieutenant asks. He looks to the Chorus gang leader. "This law dog with you?" She shakes her head. 

"Ain't got use for traitors!" she shouts back.

"Well then," he levels his blade towards you. "Seems we've got common cause after all."

The scarlet-draped woman smirks, drawing bronze. "[url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s Court of Fatebinders, always bringing people together."

Their cry comes in unison: "Charge!"</DefaultText>
