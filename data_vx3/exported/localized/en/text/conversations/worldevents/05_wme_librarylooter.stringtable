      <DefaultText>A full-figured woman in a grime-smudged smock beckons to you as your paths cross near the derelict ruins of a nameless town spread amongst the cracked stones of old Azure. She waves excitedly, almost bouncing from foot to foot. "You," she cries out, "look like a traveler of MEANS!" Her voice echoes down the abyssal crevasse between you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You pass without much interaction, brushing aside her attempts to converse. As you walk away, she continues in the opposite direction, gaze downcast.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She tugs on her bandolier, drawing attention to the numerous soot-stained scroll cases stashed on her person.

Olive eyes peer at you above a button nose and dimpled cheeks as she excitedly informs you of the rare and potent secret texts she has on offer... for a price.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She claps her hands together excitedly and begins to rattle off the sundry scrolls she's collected.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The woman blinks rapidly at your approach, a hand absently twisting her tightly braided hair. "Ah... Fatebinder. I didn't realize it was you."</DefaultText>

      <ID>12</ID>
      <DefaultText>You stride purposefully towards the woman, and inform her of your duties as a Fatebinder of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] the Adjudicator and an arbitrator of the legal code of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url].

She blanches, her mouth hanging slightly agape. From the look on her face, it seems well aware of the Court of Fatebinders.</DefaultText>

      <ID>13</ID>
      <DefaultText>You immediately inform her that she's in violation of the Overlord's provisions against the possession of forbidden knowledge. She begins to stammer an excuse, but you see her fingers forming practiced sigils.</DefaultText>

      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>You lash out at her before she has an opportunity to finish her spell. The first blow ruins her hands, and she screams, holding the mangled appendages to her chest. Your second strike ends her life. 

You rifle through her robes, discovering a small bundle of parchment. It's possible the magician had more cached away nearby, but if there's any truth to that supposition, it died with her.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>You assure her that she's in no danger from you, despite your pronouncement, and she calms, hands still free to form spells if the need arises. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Of-of course!" she stammers. "I'll tell you anything you want to know. I would not dare to keep secrets from a Fatebinder."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Uh... maybe not?" She grins sheepishly. "Best not to court the attention of the Overlord, right?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"[Player Name], meet [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] Antignia," Lantry steps forward to introduce the two of you, "Tig, meet Fatebinder [Player Name]." He proffers her a curt bow. "Sorry, I didn't recognize you at first, but I you've changed your hair and in my defense, I'm not entirely sober."</DefaultText>

      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I am Antignia, [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] of the School of Quill and Ink," she announces formally, back straightening slightly at the claim. She deflates immediately. "Or was, before the troubles at the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url]."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And I didn't recognize you as I thought you'd be a pile of ash! It's good to see you escaped the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] and are in one piece." She nods her head toward you. "Did the Fatebinder arrest you? Did I catch you being marched to Court?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Not exactly, but I'm following the Fatebinders orders - that's all you need know."

Lantry points toward the [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url]. "Antignia worked on the other side of the Citadel from me, but I've known her for ages. She's good people - mostly harmless."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yes," Antignia nods emphatically. "Entirely harmless!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But I suppose you'd know all about that, wouldn't you, Firestarter?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I mean, I'm still Antignia. Just no longer a [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url]." She frowns. "Or maybe I'm not Antignia anymore, that being the name I chose when I finished my apprenticeship." She shrugs. "I guess I'm still working out exactly how everything fits together now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She shakes her head. "Regardless, people generally just call me Tig. Feel free to."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, you see, I'm trying to make it to Ardent. And then, I don't know from there. See if a boat can take me elsewhere... maybe even venture into the north, I guess. I just want to be away from the Tiers and away from war, and just as far away as I can get from the stench of ash and soot."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Travel isn't free, though, especially now with the wartime scarcity and the Chorus looters. So I've got some scrolls, magical and historical research and the like, that I, er, rescued from the Citadel. I'm willing to part with them for rings to help me along my way."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But, uh, I - " the [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] stammers, suddenly finding her feet intensely interesting. "Surely not EVERYTHING in the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url] was forbidden. I mean, not all knowledge is evil, right?"</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Oh!" Tig looks up at you, eyes wide. "So... Did you decide you wanted some of the Ancient Secrets of the Sages?"</DefaultText>
