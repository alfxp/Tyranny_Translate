      <DefaultText>You see ahead of you a trio of carts at a standstill, their crates and barrels of goods spilled into the tall grass that lines the travel-worn road. Even from a distance you can make out a small pack of Beastmen circling a lone figure in a lusterous yellow shawl.

Their low growls carry on the wind.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you close in on the caravan, you see that the Beastmen are harnassed for hauling work. Their fur is matted and filthy, reeking of mildew and sweat, and the cart's wheels have sunken into the mud, leaving long, puckered grooves in the road. 

The beasts, claw-tipped fingers splayed in aggression, snarl at the lone human, who you recognize, with some surprise, as the merchant you met at the Bronze Brothehood's toll bridge at Ironhaul Trail. Noticing you, he cries out for a Fatebinder's aid.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Deciding not to intervene, you continue down the road, deaf to the merchant's pleas - at least until they are silenced by the Beastmen. Sobs and growls follow you until the caravan is well out of sight.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You fall on the Beastmen without hesitation, and the first hits the ground immediately, the life snuffed from its eyes. The other two turn on you, hackles bristling and saliva dripping from fangs bared. Given a momentary reprieve, the merchant dives behind one of the carts.

The nearer of the two Beastmen lowers its knuckles to the ground as it prepares to pounce. The other grasps a stone on the side of the road, pulling on it with a throaty grunt, its muscles rippling across its back.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You ready yourself as the closer Beastman pounces, driving your weapon into its open, waiting maw until it protrudes from the back of its skull, bits of brain pelting the earth like rain. You turn towards the second creature in time to see a mud-crusted stone hurtling towards you. You take the brunt of the blow on your shoulder and the world spins as your back hits the muck. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The closer Beastmen pounces and you dodge aside and dash past it, leaving it to skid and flail in the muck behind you. You come upon the second creature as it tears the stone from the ground, its back still to you. You take that opening, driving your weapon into its spine with a wet crunch.

      <DefaultText>The two Beasts glare at you, but they are stilled. The nearer creature assaults you with a truncated bark and fetid breath, but backs away. With one last look over you, the pair turn and bound away, leaving you with the merchant.</DefaultText>

      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>The beast lopes towards you on all four paws, slavering for your flesh. You lash out with your foot, catching the creature in the knee just as it raises its front claws. It howls in agony, offering you an opening to jab your weapon deep between its ribs.

It collapses beside you in the mud, shuddering before its life finally flees it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I confess I spoke ill of you after our encounter at Ironhaul, but now I entirely regret it." Aster picks mud from his drooping moustache. "Please allow me to repay your assistance. I'll halve the price of my goods for you, anything you want!" He gestures over his heavily burdened carts. "See anything you like?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Beastmen look up from the quivering merchant, pale yellow eyes falling on you, taking you in, sizing you up as if judging the quality of a meal. "Human breaks in on cart-hauling. Human should flee while still has legs."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A loud slap of paw on skin splits the air as one of the Beastmen backhands the merchant, sending him to his knees. 

The lead Beastman glances back at his packmate, then returns his glowering attention to you. "Scamper-flee, human runt. Now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You sign a sigil that illuminates your features with pale, flickering color. You unleash the arcane power as the nearer Beastman charges, and the spell tears at its flesh, sending the beast sprawling into the grime. The farther Beast takes less of the brunt of the spell, managing an agonized howl before loping away, skin raw and blistered.</DefaultText>
