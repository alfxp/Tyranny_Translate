      <DefaultText>Even in the midst of the war between the Archons, travel along the long-conquered roads of the Bastard Tier tends to be relatively safe and uneventful. A river meanders slowly aside the road, and the plains sweep openly before you towards distant towering mountains and the hazy gray line of the Oldwalls on the horizon. From your vantage atop a rise you can make out far flung settlements and small stands of trees.

On a log off the road ahead, you make out a young Tiersman, not quite a woman grown, working at an object in her lap. When she spies you, she leaps to her feet, waving to capture your attention.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The girl smiles warmly at your approach, though the expression falters slightly when she sees your heraldry. Tall and a tad lanky, the waif boasts an unkempt mop of brown hair and large eyes the color of unpolished peridot.

She asks if you are interested in a trade: an item she scavenged for the handful of rings she needs to purchase some chickens. She presents the object proudly, wrapped in a long sheet of clean cloth, and to your surprise it's a well-kept blade of expertly-worked iron.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It's a long, well-forged blade with a sharp shift in its length about halfway up the blade. The design is clearly that used by the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url], and a stamp near the hilt confirms that it was crafted by the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url].</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Pointing to the maker's mark, you tell the girl that the weapon is the rightful property of the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] and, more specifically, of the Overlord who commands their loyalty. The waif scowls, but she says nothing, lips clamped so tightly together that the color drains from them.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You glare at the girl, then slowly ask her if she really wants to be delaying the work of a Fatebinder of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] in order to sell a piece of scrap. She stammers out an apology, tucks the object under her arm, and takes off into the field at a full run. You blink as she goes, then turn and continue on your way.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Barik steps forward the moment you begin to unwrap it. "By the Great General!" he exclaims. "This is a [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] blade. And here!" He gestures at a symbol stamped near the sword's hilt. "This is the mark of the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] who made it!" He turns his attention on the girl. "Where did you find this?" he asks, striding towards her as she shrinks from him.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You offer her a small string of copper rings, and her eyes widen slightly at it before narrowing at you and the wealth obvious in your gear. She presses you for double, noting the danger of travel and the time it will take to lead you there and back.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Tiring of the waif's insubordination, you pull back your arm, readying a backhanded strike. The waif covers her head with her hands in anticipation of a slap that doesn't arrive, dropping your rings in the process.

The waif scampers away in fear and her scrawny form soon disappears into the tree line.

You reclaim your rings and continue your journey.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She leads you south across the fields over gently rolling hills sparsely cultivated with grains and vegetables. You eventually come to a lonely copse of trees, jutting from the wind-combed grass like a stone from the sea. Within the shade of the oaks you find a small squad of corpses, bloated and reeking, stripped to their smallclothes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>While you locate a few scraps of broken iron and shredded leather and find more than a little dry blood, it seems these bodies were thoroughly looted. It's surprising that the girl found even this blade left. When you ask her about it, she says she happened to find it pressed into the mud under one of the bodies.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Barik falls to his knees at the sight of the slain. "Brothers Marutius and Caelus, Sister Julia - members of the mighty seventh cohort, slain here and left with less dignity than that afforded a butchered pig." His head turns slowly towards you. "If these lands know no civility, is it not our duty to introduce it?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>You look the bodies over carefully. There are two men and a woman, each slain by violent trauma, but with heavily scarred bodies that indicate they've all been wounded numerous times prior. The evidence strongly suggests these were members of Ashe's [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] legion that finally suffered wounds against which Ashe's Aegis could not protect.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You turn on the girl, demanding she tell you what she knows of what happened here. She takes a step back, surprised by the scrutiny, and protests that everything here is as she found it, albeit a few days older. She doesn't know with certainty what occurred, though she mentions [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] raiders are a common sight in these parts.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You and Barik set to digging graves for the departed. The sun hangs blood red just above the horizon before the work is done; soaked in sweat, you look down on three nigh-identical mounds with stones as markers.

"I regret more of the legion is not here to commemorate this moment, but at least my brothers and sisters can have some dignity." Barik sighs sadly. He looks to you. "Thank you, Fatebinder. My fellows may be far from home, but they would have appreciated the honor you've shown them."</DefaultText>

The bird that returns to you is spattered with blood, the missive scrawled in a wild hand. It asks if you have an accusation to make, or whether you merely enjoy wasting the time of your betters. The note ends in a ridiculously long list of tortures he'd have put the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] soldiers through had he actually had the opportunity. The last line suggests he'll have to find someone else, perhaps a Fatebinder, to subject to such.</DefaultText>
