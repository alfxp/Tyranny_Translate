      <DefaultText>You catch a hint of movement in the distance, little more than a shiver of shadow among the remnants of a village that clings to the edge of a pillar of stone. You remain far from both [Plainsgate] and Cacophony, so it seems unlikely that settlers or soldiers lurk among the ruins.

Perhaps scavengers, raiders, or a rogue pack of Beastmen have made the crumbling buildings their home...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Adobe homes, cracked by the Overlord's [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Stone and bleached by the sun, rest in a loose semicircle around where you imagine a well or square once stood. Instead, the land ends abruptly, demarcating a plunge of hundreds of feet into the shadowed depths below.

From the windows of several of the houses spills a faint violet light.

      <DefaultText>You move quietly nearer one of the buildings, using it as cover to see within the next house, the near wall of which has conveniently collapsed. Within you see a group of humans gathered around shards of Azurelith, the pale purple crystals that appeared throughout the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url] in the wake of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]. 

As you get closer, you can see that they wear the bare minimum of clothing necessary to preserve their modesty, and their skin bears lines of light that shimmer purple against the darkness within the home.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The people within the squat building seem wholly unaware of you, their attention entirely on a shrine of collected Azurelith shards that dominates the far corner. The lines of light on their skin seem to trace primitive runes which bear a distant semblance to the markings Beastmen sometimes carve into their skin. 

The people chant quietly, invoking [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url], the fallen Archon of Stone, to restore their lands and deliver them from suffering.

      <DefaultText>Taken by surprise, the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url] denizens barely manage to raise pitchforks and falxes against you before you fall among them, your superior training and mystic power entirely overwhelming the outmatched villagers. Blood splatters the wall and pools on the floor, running along cracks in the floor to be absorbed by the thirsty stone.

It's over in moments, and you stand victorious over the corpses of the fallen.

      <DefaultText>One of the villagers, a lanky man with stringy hair, steps forward. You notice that his skin seems dry and dusty, cracked in some places like the parched earth of the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url]. His eyes shimmer with violet light, but it may only be a reflection from the Azurelith.

"We commune with the Man of the Mountain. He grants us his boons and protects us from the cruelties of this place. He shall come to us in time, to save us from the Overlord's tyrannical yoke!" The other villagers nod in agreement.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Archon of Song grins wickedly. "Much better they worship me, right?" Even as she finishes the sentence, her voice is rising into a sustained musical harmony, somehow vocalizing multiple notes at once. The villagers turn their unfocused gazes to her and slowly set aside their crystals.
