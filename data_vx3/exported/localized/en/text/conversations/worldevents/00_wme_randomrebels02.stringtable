      <DefaultText>You stop short as a javelin plants itself in the ground at your feet. Several [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] soldiers seemingly materialize from nowhere on the road ahead, axes hefted and javelins drawn. Grit clings to tarnished bronze armor and dust hides in the folds of threadbare cloth. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You see the soldiers marching in formation on the road ahead of you. They don't seem openly aggressive, but as they come nearer, you realize that they're flying the standard of Old Stalwart. Upon noting you, the leader raises a gauntleted hand in a fist, and the group stops short. The standard bearer sinks her flag into the soil.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You round a bend in the road and come face to face with a group of warriors in bronze mail and heavy, jagged helms, each seated on a rock or leaning against a tree. They look to you, slowly rising to their feet, readying axes and mauls.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Stormcaller!" the leader calls out. "We are the true sons and daughters of Old Stalwart. You ruined our cities and fields with your [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url], shattered our nation's royal line, and stolen our greatest citadel, yet we persist. So long as the blood of Stalwart runs through these veins," he slaps an open palm against his sword arm, "the Overlord shall be resisted! Your blood, however, will water these roads. To the void with you, bane of Stalwart!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Governor," one greets you with a mocking bow. "One would think that Raetommon would have had you killed when you returned, given everything you've done to us. But he didn't, and now he's dead." The warriors lower their shoulders and bend their knees, readying to strike. "Those of us left, we've no intention of repeating that mistake."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder," one says darkly. "Surely you didn't think that the Brotherhood ended with Raetommon. Surely you didn't think that we'd forget or forgive his end." The warriors lower their shoulders and bend their knees, readying to strike. "Surely you knew it would come to this: the Brotherhood's end or yours."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder!" the leader calls out, extending an index finger towards you. "We are the true sons and daughters of Stalwart. You may have slaughtered our Regent, but you have not defeated us. So long as the blood of Stalwart runs through these veins," he slaps an open palm against his sword arm, "the Overlord shall be resisted! Your blood, however, will water these roads. Die, slave of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You've barely gotten the first words out when the Bronze Brother cuts you off with a swipe of his blade. "We're not here for words." He whistles, and his cohort charges.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"He has a point," a tall man with a maul mutters. The mercenary leader looks to him, then among his compatriots. He scowls at you. "We'll let you go. This time." The Brothers leave you to continue your journey.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The mercenaries glance at one another when you offer them an iron ring. "You think an iron pays for the lives you've taken? It doesn't begin to!" Shouts rise from his fellows. "That said, we're not unreasonable. Make it five iron, and we'll forget we saw you. For today, at least."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You shout at the soldiers, reminding them that you took their keep from them, slain dozens of them already, and called down Edicts.

"You must be under the impression," their leader says grimly, "that we have something left to lose." He raises his weapon, and his men charge.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You speak of their bravery and that of the people of their homeland. The death of Straydus was a regrettable necessity to free the region from the yoke of the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Storms. This cycle of violence need not continue here today. They need not throw away their lives, lives that would be better served helping their home rebuild.

The squad's leader wipes his face. "Perhaps you're right. Perhaps there's still work to be done in Stalwart." He looks to his fellows, and they nod in agreement. "Farewell, Fatebinder. May we never meet again." </DefaultText>
