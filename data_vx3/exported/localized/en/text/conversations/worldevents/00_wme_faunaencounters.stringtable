      <DefaultText>You tense as a heavy gray form flashes across the path before you: long, ribbed horns curve in graceful arcs from its skull, and hooves thunder against the stone. An ibex! Hundreds of pounds of muscle, hide, and bone, quick and crafty, and you with only a moment to react.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Marching your way along a backcountry road, you spot a small flock of rotund, feathered beasts waddling around through the grass down the hill. You recognize them as [url=glossary:flightless]flightless[/url] - irritable birds whose tough flesh seems a staple of life for many communities in the Tiers. You could almost certainly pick one of the creatures off for your dinner.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you walk along the bank of a small streams, you hear splashing coming from the reedy shallows. You recognize it as the sound of the rushfish.

While no delicacy, the flesh of the rushfish is a common staple in Tiersmen cuisine. You look down into the water and see three of the whiskered creatures, fat and oblivious...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A rabbit stands statue still just off of the road ahead of you. As you come to a stop, its brown ear twitches, and you suspect that it's about to bolt into the nearby underbrush.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you walk along a lonely stretch of open road, you see a single dog walking towards you. Its front right paw must be bad, judging by its uneven limp. A few breaks in its matted fur outline old scars. If it's noticed you, it hasn't given any indication of the fact.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you pick your way across the rocky wilderness, you find what you at first take to be a bundle of cloth. Brief investigation, however, reveals it to be the dry, discarded scales of a serpent. Spreading it out, you realize the reptile must be twice your height and as thick as a gatepost. 

Snakes of the Tiers are often venomous, but their meat is light, if chewy, with a flavor generally considered superior to the [url=glossary:flightless]flightless[/url] birds that the Tiersmen prefer to hunt. A serpent of this size, however, may not be worth the effort...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Taking a break from your journey at a small freshwater pond, you notice several small troughs in the soft soil at the water's edge. Mud has been splattered about, and you recognize it as a telltale sign of wild hogs. Nearby hoof prints confirm your suspicions.

The markings seem fresh; the animal can't be far.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You make out a light rustling not far from your campsite. Wary of an ambush, you quietly flank the source of the sound only to come upon a foot-long grayish tube of flesh: a graveworm. 

These pallid creatures do much to enrich the soil of the Tiers, but their meat can also make a bland, chewy meal if need dictates.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Beastwoman walks over to the dog, her knuckles brushing the dusty ground. She scratches the dog behind the ear with a single long claw, then scoops her up and brings her to you. She sets the dog on the ground, then holds your eye in hers.

"Beastwoman brought dog to human who smells of Fatebinder." She then lopes away, leaving you with the dog. It looks up at you, crooked tail wagging. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Human who smells of Fatebinder eats soil beast?" She shrugs, and approaches the worm, which makes a lethargic, belated attempt to burrow away.

The Shadowhunter effortlessly yanks its head from the dirt, and brings it to you. It undulates slowly in her palm, but has little way to defend itself.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Her thought and action one, Verse has an arrow nocked even as you give the order. She tracks the creature for only a moment before letting fly. The arrow catches it in the hindquarters, sending it stumbling before it regains its footing and barrels on along the rocks. Verse lets out a primal howl and takes off after it, dancing along the stones with at least as much grace as her quarry.

When she returns half an hour later, it is without the beast. She shrugs and says, "It's fucking heavy, Binder." She instead leads you to the carcass.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Verse grins. "Used to do this on the farm. Knew I wasn't worthwhile if I couldn't catch a [url=glossary:flightless]flightless[/url] barehanded. Still got a few scars. Vicious little shits." She hunkers down and slips into the grass. As you watch, she makes her way down to the edge of the clearing, then leaps forth, running among the [url=glossary:flightless]flightless[/url] and sending them fleeing in every direction. Like a great cat, she picks out one and gives chase, leaping upon it and wrestling it to the dirt.

When she makes her way back up the hill, she's leaking from a few new cuts, but her smile is brighter than her blood.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Verse looks at you, looks to the rabbit, looks back at you. "Really?" Her hands rest on her hips. "You can't think of any better use for my time?" In a flash you can barely follow, she hurls a dagger from sheathe to rabbit's belly, pinning it to the soil. She walks over, draws the blade from the dirt, wipes it on her tattered apparel, and walks away, leaving the twitching rabbit carcass for you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Verse looks the discarded husk over. "You sure you want to tangle with something large enough to leave THAT behind?" She shrugs, readies an arrow, and leaves the road behind.

You hear her return before you see her, and when she comes into sight she's dragging a massive snake behind her, hands grasping the shaft of the arrow driven entirely through the creature's head. She heaves it to the ground, panting, and wipes her brow.

"Next time," she manages between heavy breaths, "you get to, manhandle the snake."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"With pleasure," Verse says with a grin. She sniffs her armpits, nods slightly, then glances up at you. "What? They can smell you coming if you're not careful." She stalks off of the road.

Hours later, she returns empty-handed and scowling. "Leave it," she grunts as she turns down the road. A final muttered oath makes its way to you: "Fucking pigs."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>While no fisherman, you know a thing or two about rushfish feeding habits from your studies of the natural world. You thread and tie off a needle before bending it into a rough hook, then push it through the fatty thorax of a carob beetle. You wait by the shore, spying out a likely target, then lower the carob beetle into the water.

Surely enough, the fish swallows the insect whole. With a sharp yank, you set the hook, and then pull the heavy catch from the water.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You stare at the water for a time, watching the fish move. Perhaps if you had some manner of trap for them... You rig a noose of sorts, a loop of rope and a slipknot. You lay it in the path of the fish, waiting for one to swim through it. When one does, you pull quickly to tighten the rope.

The fish easily flops free of your trap.

This clumsy process plays out a few more times before you discard both your plans and your hope for a dinner of rushfish.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Beastmen rarely hunt rushfish - they provide little meat relative to the effort required - but when there's ample bait, the agile fish become a patient hunter's bounty. You learned when you were still young how to catch some mudbugs, thread line through them, and set them as lures. You wait patiently, allowing the crustaceans to burrow into soil near the shore. You easily draw two of the fleshy animals from the water.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you sweep up the cylindrical beast in your arms, it tries in vain to wriggle back into the dirt. Using a knife, you slice deeply into it, spilling its lukewarm ichor across your arms. You continue to cut it apart, and its constituent parts continue to writhe under your loving ministrations long after any reasonable creature should have expired.

At least there's a fair amount of mostly-edible meat.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Following the shreds of discarded snake scale requires a sharp eye and patience, but soon enough you find the massive, coiled form of a moth serpent, a large, venomous snake named for the repeated moth-shaped pattern running it down its back. The snake raises its head and flicks a forked tongue in your direction...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Moving quietly through the wilds, you follow the torn bark, muddy leaves, and hoof prints that mark the passage of the boars.

She raises her hands towards the sky, her fingers twisting, shaping sigils, calling down the light of the Grave, brightening it, spilling it liberally across the soil. The dirt churns, and more of the long, pale creatures wriggle up from the muck, turning sucking mouths towards the sky.

Eb gestures with an open palm. "Take your pick, Fatebinder."</DefaultText>
