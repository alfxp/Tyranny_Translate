      <DefaultText>No longer blasted by the endless winds of the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Storms, the [url=glossary:blade grave]Blade Grave[/url] seems an endless expanse of twisted metal spines and rough-hewn cliffsides. Life has yet to return to Stalwart - you hear no birds and glimpse no rodents.

But today you make out a billowing cloud of brightly shimmering movement. It's a few hundred feet away still, but moving down the ravine towards you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>For a moment you think it some kind of massive Bane, a huge creature of roiling arcane malice, but then you realize it's not a single entity. You search your mind for the stories Tiers fauna when you recall the [url=glossary:chrysalis]Chrysalis[/url], winged insects that travels in swarms. The [url=glossary:chrysalis]Chrysalis[/url] are pests, known to burrow into trees, ships, and homes to lay their eggs.

Consider the massive deforestation of Stalwart by the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Storms, one wonders what this swarm has been eating these days...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Those are [url=glossary:chrysalis]Chrysalis[/url], Fatebinder," Barik tells you, a hint of awe in his voice. "I haven't seen a swarm in, well, since the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Storms. They're pests, but mostly harmless. Burrow into wooden posts and planks. But I didn't think they could form that large a swarm... should we find cover?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ah, the [url=glossary:chrysalis]Chrysalis[/url]! Or at least, a local species of the type. They actually quite harmless," Lantry opines. "Provided you're not a house. Or a boat. Or crops. Or if they've been denied plant matter for too long, then they turn carnivorous."

As he begins to launch into the various subspecies that have been observed in the Tiers, the cloud grows ever closer.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The [url=glossary:chrysalis]Chrysalis[/url]!" Eb says the name like it's a social disease. "Disgusting, burrowing bugs that devour carpentry. When they run out of wet lumber to eat, they've been known to eat animal flesh... especially when swarming... like they are now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Crouched with palms flat against the grit, Kills-In-Shadow sniffs at the air. "Burrow bugs. Eat trees and human walls of wood. Swarm makes song like wind in leaves." Her snout twitches slightly as the cloud grows closer.

"Burrow bugs smell of blood. May burrow flesh. Should find hard stone shelter."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You work your way carefully among the rocks as the baleful buzz crescendos. Through the gap behind you, you make out a turbid fog of shining carapaces. 

A few insects break from the swarm, alighting on the stone near you. Their wings boast symmetrical pearlescent swirls, and their mandibles, sharp enough to shear through wood, chitter in mesmerizing syncopation.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Grabbing your gear, you make haste for the entrance to the ravine. Glancing back, you see the swarm, despite its size, seems to be gaining on you. A low, droning sound surrounds you as you realize you won't make it to the mouth of this valley before the horde is upon you. The walls here, however, are filled with gaps you may be able to use for climbing or shelter.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You reach the top of the gorge and roll away from the swarm's path. You watch as the turbulent cloud rages between the stones, the swarm coming terrifyingly close to you. Perhaps more at home hunting closer to the ground, the swarm loses interest in this high vantage point and the cloud of [url=glossary:chrysalis]Chrysalis[/url] slowly flutter back to ground level.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Shields, blades, human bones, and the carapaces of armor jut into your path, halting your progress.

You attempt to work your way carefully among the rocks as a baleful buzz rises to crescendo.

Your muscles aching and your knees and arms seeping blood from a half dozen scrapes, you realize there's no way you'll squeeze into a crevasse before the swarm is upon you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Before you can pull yourself to the top, 
the turbulent cloud rages around you, insects alight on your clothes, hands, and face, crawling into your ears and nose, across the lids of your closed eyes. Where they find exposed flesh, they bite and bore into you, their mandibles a hundred tiny sickles carving your skin.

You force yourself forward, throwing yourself over the canyon wall, heedless of whatever danger may be above. You roll desperately across the ground, leaving a swath crushes insects as your tumble.

When you finally free yourself from the insects, you're left with the pain of hundreds of stinging wounds across your flesh, and the incessant drone of the swarm still lingering in your ears.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The swarm slowly approaching, you search out one of the caves that riddles the sides of the ravine. Carved from the stone by [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' incessant winds, the walls of the narrow fissure rise and fall like the waves of a frozen sea. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The sound reaches a crescendo as your magic does, but before you can snap your fingers into the final figure, the wave of oncoming creatures crashes over you like a battering ram, pushing you backwards, alighting on your cloths, and biting at your skin. Jaw locked in concentration you manage to finish your spell, dissipating the cloud of creatures into the air.

Gulping for air in ragged breaths, you wipe sweat from your brow and blood from your skin before continuing toward your destination.</DefaultText>
