      <DefaultText>The three groups look at you expectantly. The Chorus gang leader, a stout woman in ragged leather and hide, rests her hands on the pommels of her bronze blades. The [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] commander, compactly muscled under his heavy iron armor, has shield and blade at the ready. The apparent spokeswoman of the Sages, a short woman in blue scribe's clothes, glares openly, chin raised slightly as if she hopes to ward off [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' troops through the weight of her disdain.</DefaultText>
