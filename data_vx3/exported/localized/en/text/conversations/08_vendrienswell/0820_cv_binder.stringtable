      <DefaultText>The [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] trembles, clinging to a dilapidated sack of what appears to be intricate pieces of stonework adorned with deep purple crystals.

"Ah, a Fatebinder! Someone with some reason! Please, could you instill some of it into these beasts?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url]'s lips quiver as he attempts to form a sensible sentence. "We had no idea we were trespassing. We came to explore the ruins, fill our libraries with more knowledge about the lost kingdom of Azure, nothing more!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh, these old things?" He adjusts his grip on the sack of artifacts. "Yes, judging from the designs they could be, but we need more samples to verify these findings." His eyes continually dart back to the salivating Beastmen.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This is an outrage!" His face puffs up with a fit of rage. "We haven't come this far just to-" The [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url]'s rant is cut short by the deep snarl of the Beastwoman who continues to grow agitated by their presence. 

The [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] attempts to speak, but nothing comes out. He looks back to you, his face beaded with sweat. "P-Perhaps we have overstepped. We shall make our exit at once. I'm sure you will express our deepest apologies to that... large one over there."

He nods to the rest of his company and they quickly scramble away towards the passage.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We haven't done any trespassing, these lands are NOT for them to claim." The Beastmen inch closer to the group of huddled Sages. "Listen, we'll-we'll share ALL our findings with them, if you can just explain to them our position. Please, Fatebinder!" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] blinks with bewilderment. "Are we not better than [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' thugs, extorting the downtrodden?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url]'s mouth presses tightly into a thin red line. "Fine, hopefully our lives are worth what little rings we have." He reaches deep into his sack of relics and produces a handful of rings and hands them over.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] trembles, clinging to a dilapidated sack of what appears to be intricate pieces of stonework adorned with deep purple crystals.

"Fatebinder, a most welcome ally. Please, if you'll just tell these Beastmen to let us pass, we'll be on our way."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The humor is lost on the [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] as made evident by the scowl on his face. "A strange time for humor, Fatebinder."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We hail from the School of Ink and Quill." His eyes never leave the sight of the Beastmen for more than a moment. "We've come to explore the ruins, learn more about the lost Kingdom of Azure. They claim we trespass, but these are [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' lands now, NOT theirs."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Beastwoman hacks out a series of amused laughs through a sharp-toothed grin. “Good, good. Is good to see cowardly humans scamper away with tails between legs. Nearly as good as tearing soft bellies open of prey. Fatebinder has done well.”

She extends a muscular arm to the ground and picks up a small object. “Human Sages ran too fast. Dropped relics stolen from [url=glossary:stonestalker]Stonestalker[/url] lands.” Rib-Splitter drops the item into your hand. “Fatebinder should take as trinket from conquered foe.” She flashes a toothy grin before returning to her pack.</DefaultText>
