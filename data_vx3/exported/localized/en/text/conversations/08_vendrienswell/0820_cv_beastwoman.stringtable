      <DefaultText>"Stop squirming, human - unless mystic trespassers wish to die on Rib-Splitter's claws. Explain presence." She sneers widely, her massive fangs yellowed and flecked with saliva. "Explain why humans have been caught ferreting in [url=glossary:stonestalker]Stonestalker[/url] territory."  </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"F-ferreting?!" The [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] explodes, lurching forward in his outburst, despite his obvious aversion to being near the Beastwoman. He quickly regains himself and stumbles several steps back. "We're researching, Beastwoman! And last I checked, these lands belonged to the Overlord - not you, and not your kind."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Human." The word is a growled warning at your approach.

Jerking her head in your direction, Rib-Splitter takes a deep whiff, dark nostrils flared wide. Recognition swirls to the surface of her feral eyes, and she hacks an amused laugh. 

"Fatebinder," she amends. "Alpha who [url=glossary:prima]Prima[/url] has recognized. Who Hundred-Blood and whole tribe fight beside."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Humans call sniffing and digging - stealing from Beastwomen-lands - research?"

She stalks forward and the Sages shrink back. She snarls, claws out, a muscled mass of violence, fur, and anger.

"Does not matter. [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url] will slaughter ferreting humans and researching humans, same. Will split-slice ribs of any who slink into tribe's territory."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Spooked, the [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] glances side to side, the whites of his eyes showing as he searches wildly for an escape.

"Fatebinder! Help! Please, you must help us!"

He waves frantically, trying to skirt around the slathering Beastwoman, but she steps into his path, stalking ever closer - pinning him in.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Beastwoman howls and purrs her contentment, the sound like rocks rattling together in her chest. She stalks closer to the clustered, cowering Sages, long, wickedly curved claws splayed menacingly in the air - eager.

"Ferreting, thieving humans will scurry through [url=glossary:stonestalker]Stonestalker[/url]-lands, no more."</DefaultText>

Her massive maws split into a sharp-fanged grin. A promise of violence.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder is right. Is not merely human who [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url] fight for. Is also tribe's kith." She nods, pleased at the thought. "Rib-Splitter likes human who is kith. Maybe will rut with later. Maybe will make scream and writhe."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Beastwoman snarls and gnashes her teeth, ired by your decision. For a moment, she gauges you with wild eyes, verging on an attack, but whatever she sees bridles her, and slowly, she settles into a low crouch instead. 

"Alpha has decided. And as Hundred-Blood has demanded, Beastwoman will listen."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Viciously, she turns on the Sages and growls that they are free to flee.

"Do not let Rib-Splitter catch scent of Sages so soon in Stone-lands again. Or Beastwoman will not hold back."

She glances to you one final time, a smugness set in her snout.

"Despite what Fatebinder wishes."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Linus jolts on his feet as if arrow-struck. His words sputter from his lips, an incoherent, yelping retort.

      <DefaultText>The Beastwoman cocks her head to one side, considering your suggestion. Finally, she snorts and nods.

"Beastwoman will leave [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url]-mystics be, for now. But if humans prove to have no purpose, if are of no worth to [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url], Rib-Splitter and whole pack will slaughter Sages." She snarls menacingly. "Without mercy."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She shakes her head as if bemused at your sudden appearance, here, so far from the tribe's den, and in this moment - during her conflict with a pack of Sages.

      <DefaultText>"Th-thank you, Fatebinder. I'm glad you could make these beasts see reason." He eyes Rib-Splitter warily, clutching the sack of artifacts close to his chest. "Hopefully they'll come to see that our findings have value... for our sakes." He reaches into the tattered bag to grab an object. Here, take this. It is of historical significance - I think it a worthy exchange for our lives."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"[url=glossary:prima]Prima[/url]." The title rumbles out excitedly from Rib-Splitter, who lowers her head in a show of respect. The Beastwoman's lips part in an eager smile and she laves her sizable fangs in anticipation. "Trespassing Sages are right to tremble in fear. [url=glossary:prima]Prima[/url] has come to assert dominion over [url=glossary:stonestalker]Stonestalker[/url] lands."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She cocks her head at an angle, curious eyes roving across your body. “Rib-Splitter does not know of human officers or things called courts. But can see that one called Fatebinder has flesh as soft as all other humans. Perhaps Beastwoman’s pack should tear Fatebinder to pieces along with cowardly Sages.”</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>“Skulking humans show disrespect for [url=glossary:stonestalker]Stonestalker[/url] tribe. Must die for stealing and slinking and smelling of fear.” Rib-Splitter wrinkles her nose and grimaces. “Fatebinder can join in hunt."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Rib-Splitter’s growls soften into a nervous rumbling of the chest. She glances at her packmates, who begin to snarl in alarm like cornered prey. A soft whine escapes the leader's lips, and the Beastwoman dips her head in submission. 

“Fatebinder speaks fiercely. Rib-Splitter can see that human's words will be followed by blood and fang. Pack will not fight Fatebinder. Will listen... but cannot leave Sages that defile [url=glossary:stonestalker]Stonestalker[/url] lands.” Her amber eyes watch you cautiously. “What does Fatebinder want?

      <DefaultText>“Human.” The word is a growled warning at your approach.

Jerking her head in your direction, the Beastwoman takes a deep whiff, dark nostrils flared wide. “Rib-Splitter does not recognize human’s scent... but sees that human walks uninvited upon [url=glossary:stonestalker]Stonestalker[/url] lands.” She fixes a predatory eye upon the shaking Sages. “Is skulking prey, just like sniveling [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] that wets loins when startled."</DefaultText>

Believes that human does not come as trickster for soft-boned Sages. But pack will not follow Fatebinder's - tribe outsider's - commands.”</DefaultText>
