"As the Binder suggests, the Archive is a testament to how the Sages should have seen the patterns of history, and should have seen the invetiable rise of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url].

[url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] shakes his head. "Do not try to hide behind the shields of the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url], Fatebinder.
