      <DefaultText>"Who said anything about standing up to the Overlord? I consider myself better than the other Archons - but I'm not rushing to pick a fight with [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That's a sentiment that might just keep those close to you alive a little longer...  but [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' current orders are for us Archons to play a little culling dance... and I have to admit, I love it when the Overlord temporarily relaxes the peace. It keeps things interesting."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's generally not the Overlord's preferred method of sorting out problems, but sometimes events conspire to put too many sharks in the same pond. When [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] set the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Execution over the heads of both armies, I knew the Overlord felt there were too many Archons and too little cooperation - this forced conflict seemed inevitable."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I have conquered the Tiers in [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' name, and dealt with the Archons as the Overlord requested. Odd that I would be rewarded with an invading army."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Is it so odd? Considering it's easier for [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] to bury you now... than chance that you might become... too large a threat later..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I think [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] overestimates my ambition. The Tiers are conquered in the name of the Overlord, I will inform [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] the job is complete - reinforcements are not needed."</DefaultText>

The Archon winces, choking back blood in his throat.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If you want to take this power of yours and... be the Overlord's lackey, be my guest. But you'll need to convince [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] you're worth the risk. Surrender to the Overlord - reaffirm your obedience and maybe, just maybe, [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] will take a chance on you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Who knows, maybe with me gone, [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] will need someone new to keep things amsuing."

He gasps, drowning as his lungs fill with blood. The light in his eyes dim as his pupils seep blackness, expanding to fill the whole of his eyes. A look of meaning passes between you, his fingers digging into the ground.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If you intend to stay true to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], kid, you'd better send word at once. From what I know of the Overlord - and of your own power - [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] has to assume you a threat until given a clear reason to think otherwise. You want to de-escalate the tension... you should start... providing some words of supplication."</DefaultText>
