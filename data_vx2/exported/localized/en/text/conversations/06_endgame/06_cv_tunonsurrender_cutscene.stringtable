      <DefaultText>"Do you think [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] cares about your fealty? You are a threat, a challenge to the Overlord's unique capacity. Co-existence will require supplication to the Overlord. If you can convince [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] that your loyalty outweighs your arcane gifts, then perhaps further bloodshed could be avoided."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"May [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] deem your actions loyal... for both our sakes."

"If you want to make your intentions clear, shout your loyalty to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] from atop the Mountain Spire, for all the Tiers to hear. The gesture will mean more if the supplication is public."</DefaultText>
