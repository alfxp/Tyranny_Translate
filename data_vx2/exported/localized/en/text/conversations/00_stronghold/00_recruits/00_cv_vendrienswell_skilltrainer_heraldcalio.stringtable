      <ID>154</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The short answer is [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] and the entire tribal culture that he martyred himself to defend. That tribalism is clearly part of their strength, if not how they're bound to the Archon of War. Of course, such sentiments undermine attempts at occupying the Tiers." 

She lowers her voice further. "Were it not for fear of the Court, I wonder if he'd eliminate every last Tiersman to establish his version of 'order.'"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>157</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That's a complicated issue. Legally, the Tiers haven't been brought entirely into the fold as part of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' dominion. Until they are, they aren't fully subject to the Overlord's laws, which means that they're open to be claimed by whoever has the strength of arms to hold them."</DefaultText>

      <ID>158</ID>
      <DefaultText>"In theory, once the area has been pacified, the Overlord could carve it up and parcel it out. In practice, [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] tends to grant governorships to those who took the land. This is how the Overlord has made many of his most substantial gains. He offers Archons the choice to either carve out a kingdom to rule over or die. Many find that an easy choice to make."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>159</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But again, that is a gross oversimplification. One could pursue the horizon for months without seeing all of the lands under the Overlord's sway. Ultimately [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] is pragmatic and establishes rule as best befits a territory."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Leadership has always been a matter of personal style. The way you guide your recruits differs starkly from how Rhogalus commands his scribes or Nunoval drills his retainers. The same holds for our Archons. The Adjudicator's Court bears little resemblance to Iron Hearth, for example, and less to Cacophony. The Overlord codifies this as the Right of Privilege: so long as an Archon remains loyal to the Overlord and upholds the legal code, [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] grants them significant freedom to rule their dominion as they see fit."</DefaultText>

      <ID>162</ID>
      <DefaultText>"As a result, some territories seem wildly different from others. They say that were you to travel the length of Terratus, you'd find yourself in a different empire every span. Only the Overlord's law unites them. In a way, our code - our Court - is the blood coursing through the empire's veins. We are the order that makes civilization possible."</DefaultText>

      <ID>163</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I've heard tell that over time, an Archon's relationship to their territory can grow deeper than we can imagine. The line between them and their land blurs. Rhogalus is partial to the story of Moramus of the Mire, but look at [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] and the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url]. Lingering Edicts aren't exactly rare, and they shape the lands even as the Archon administrators do... and even as the lands shape the Archons. Taken together, it's all rather muddled."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>164</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Isn't that a question better suited to our esteemed Fatebinder Rhogalus?" She smirks. "Since you're asking me, I assume you want a practical answer rather than an academic lecture. My thoughts: magicians merely imitate. They take the Archons' sigils, study them for secrets, tweak and twist them, experiment with them, and commit the various forms they can take to memory. Through rote practice, they learn to perform specific and discrete effects."</DefaultText>

      <ID>165</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Archons, however, have neither such recourse nor similar limitation. Their power comes from within, not some external template. Each Archon manifests their own peculiar talents, sometimes abilities never before seen, sometimes twists on powers that have been seen in the past. Further, those abilities can change over time, becoming more potent and flexible."</DefaultText>

      <ID>166</ID>
      <DefaultText>"How does one become an Archon? What conjunction of occurrences births their abilities? From what well do they draw when they manifest their will within the world?

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>169</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Nobody knows. The Adjudicator's most infamous abilities are his judgments: terrible sentences that carry mystical weight, from encasing an individual in a block of ice to cursing someone guilty of arson to burst into flames. The only consistent theme of his power is that he only turns his magic on entities he's declared guilty of a criminal act, but who can say if that's his choice, a limitation of the power, or some combination of both?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>170</ID>
      <DefaultText>She lowers her voice further, leaning in. "It's been suggested," she shoots a brief glance towards Rhogalus, who, involved in a scroll, misses it entirely, "that the judgments are somehow related to the Overlord's declared Edicts. That because he speaks for [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], Archon [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] can draw on some of that same power. I'm not saying I don't believe it, but [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] could level mountains, too, and his relationship with the Overlord was never particularly cordial."</DefaultText>

      <ID>171</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Otherwise, the Archon of Justice doesn't flaunt his abilities. I've heard that he smells the presence of a criminal action on an individual. Some say he can see the final moments of a murder victim by drinking the juices of her eyes. Others claim he has an ear attuned to threshing truth from falsehood. Of course, the Tiersmen spread the same rumor about us." She chuckles. "I don't correct them, either."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"[url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] claims that his name has always been [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url], much as he expects us to carry out our service without resorting to sobriquets or pseudonyms. Our Archon of War was only 'Ashe' before [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] added the 'Graven.' And [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]..." She lapses into a momentary, considered silence. "I've always suspected that was the Overlord's private joke." She shakes her head as if rattling the idea free. "Suffice it to say, when you've drawn that much attention, you're called what the Overlord calls you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She regards you in silence for a moment. "I think of them as one in the same. They're all part of the same howling, gaping, hungry maw that consumes everything. The Voices is no scholar - he doesn't study to better understand the world or to find meaning in the past. He consumes knowledge because it grants him power. His mob hunts that knowledge and conveys it to him." She smirks. "And frankly, thugs are easier to control in many ways than scholars."</DefaultText>

      <ID>177</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her nose wrinkles slightly. "On one hand, everybody knows, but on the other, nobody's really sure." She grins. "Confused? So at its core, the situation was this: [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] could barely be considered loyal to the Overlord at the best of times. He wasn't so foolish as to stand directly against [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], but he always did the absolute minimum necessary to avoid [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url]'s blades."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Or his withering frowns, anyway. [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] was one Archon that [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] couldn't easily kill.

      <DefaultText>"What caused him to disregard orders entirely and start rutting with the Beastmen in Azure? I don't have that answer. I'm not sure that anybody does. But I can tell you with some confidence what finally convinced [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] that an example needed to be made of him: he suggested that the Overlord had no claim on the Tiers. Hard to say whether he said it to anyone other than [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] and the Beasts, but that was enough."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That varies depending on the needs of the Empire at any given time. Right now, with the Conquest of the Tiers ongoing, the Archons of War and Secrets have been given leave to aggressively recruit and field massive forces. Nunoval told me that the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] is one of the largest gangs of miscreants to have served a single commander in recent history. Archon Ashe's [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] boast better weapons and tighter tactics than most other forces in the Overlord's dominion can field."</DefaultText>

You know, I'm sure, that sigils are derived from the personal marks of the Archons. My understanding is that it goes a bit deeper than that - that there's something of a question about whether the Archons are stamping their will indelibly on Terratus or unearthing some hitherto unknown aspect of magic and giving shape to it. It's one of those questions that serve little pragmatic purpose."</DefaultText>

Most guilds guard their secrets closely, but secrets have a way of slipping free.

Thus far, the Overlord has always had some new front to set soldiers against, some new land to conquer and opponent to villainize. What's left when the entire world falls under your control? Do you start melting down swords into plows and devote yourself to developing the society you wanted to establish when you first set yourself to war?
