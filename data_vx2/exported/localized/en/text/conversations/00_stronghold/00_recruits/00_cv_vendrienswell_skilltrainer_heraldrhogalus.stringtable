      <DefaultText>An eyebrow rises. "The Adjudicator willingly bent the knee to you, Archon. The Court of Fatebinders readily serves you. What further needs be said?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You verge upon the unification of the Tiers, as the Overlord commanded. I doubt [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] envisioned these particular results, however." Dark circles hang from his piercing eyes.

"Beyond that, I would prefer to hold private my thoughts, Archon." He bows his head.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Witnesses to the event claim your voice thundered across the valley at [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url] and that the elements heeded your clarion command. Such a feat, to recall one of the Overlord's Edicts and reissue it to your own advantage... unprecedented. Have you upended history? Or has this played out as the Overlord wills?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You treat with Renata and the other remnants of the School of Ink and Quill." Rhogalus hisses as his eyes narrow. "You should take far greater care in who you bring into your confidences."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You have assembled a panoply to stoke the envy of kings. The manifest power that attends you is palpable. Yet I wonder to what end you intend to turn it. Whose council do you keep, if not the Adjudicator's? This Conquest, once at the cusp of victory, teeters on the brink of absolute chaos." He seems to peer past you into the distance. "One almost hears laughter echoing in the shadows."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The spines of a thousand Tiersmen bend beneath your heavy tread. The Archon of War owes you much. Does he recognize it? Or do you remain a mere asset to him? An agent, however capable, to turn against his myriad enemies?" He cocks his head slightly. "The court wonders in whispers: where will your loyalty fall when [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] inevitably acts against the Adjudicator? One cannot serve as both a champion of justice and a tool of war."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You come among us cloaked in blood and secrets, but stories of your deeds precede you to the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url]. Chaos attends you, scored with the screams of your victims and the tears of their families. The Voices makes of you an effigy in his own form - a gyre around which a storm of madness orbits. We can only hope that you remain clear-eyed about your first loyalty... your duty to the Court."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"On one hand, you bring together habitual enemies into a coherent force that could govern the Tiers from within. On the other, each victory you claim comes at a cost to the Overlord's chosen warlords. I'm sure you can see how one's opinion of you might be conflicted."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Your work at [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] has allayed some of the suspicion you garnered after the events at [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url]. In earning Master Zdenya's support and championing her [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url], you display a public commitment to the preservation of our cherished traditions." His fingers smooth his graying mustache. "Take care though not to tread on the Adjudicator's toes. The [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] guild ultimately answers to Archon [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]. The conflict of interests is minimal, so long as you remain loyal to his vision."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Eschewing the Chorus and the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] for Free City mercenaries..." He rubs the bridge of his nose between forefinger and thumb. "The measure of an individual is in the company they keep. You ally comfortably with base and common individuals."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Fatebinder's lip curls beneath his hooked nose. "You should concern yourself more with Calio's opinion of you and the respect you show our office. I suspect that you come dangerously close to earning her focused attention."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Rhogalus crosses his arms. "You have supported the war effort admirably, [Player Name]. I must caution you to maintain your objectivity, however, lest that support collapse into sycophancy. You owe your fealty, first and foremost, to the Archon [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] and the legal code he evenhandedly enforces."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Beyond that, I will not pretend that I find the company of others enjoyable - or even bearable - at most times. Your particular shiftlessness as an officer of this court has thus far failed to engender in me any regard for you." His gaze flickers across your features. "No offense intended."</DefaultText>
