      <DefaultText>[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' demands have been answered. The Tiers have been conquered, unified under a single Archon. All that stands now is to inform the Overlord of your success.

Or, you could seize the Tiers entirely as your own, with a demonstration of your power to declare your sovereignty. You could, with the sum total of effort, project your will far north, past the edge of the Tiers, and proclaim your [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] as far as the lands of the Northern Empire.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A moment passes, and far to the north and east, bolts of copper-hued lightning roil between the clouds, a spectacle last seen a century ago, when the Northern Kingdom fell to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] and become the Northern Empire.

The conquest of the Tiers, and of all Terratus, is at long last, complete.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With your work here in the Tiers all but complete, you take a deep breath of the cool, tranquil Spire air and allow yourself a moment to think.

By the letter of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' orders, you have done all that is asked. You delivered the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Execution and brought the Archons to heel as ordered.

While you have the victory of the moment to savor, you find yourself wanting for answers. Only the Archons have met [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], and while you are now counted among these luminaries, the battlefield promotion was hardly the revealing initiation rite you long imagined all Archons experience.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Looking back on the events of the war, it seems implausible that this moment has caught [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] entirely by surprise. Half a league beneath your feet sits [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url] - had the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Execution not been stopped, the resulting deaths would have done the work of the civil war and the culling call of the Archons.

      <DefaultText>If the Overlord is indeed prescient of anything, this moment was a long time coming.

It could be reasoned that [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] wanted the strongest Archon to rule the Tiers alone. It also stands to reason [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] was willing to put [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] and [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] on a collision course to discovering the Spires. It seems easy to imagine even the civil war was part of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' plan.

Your mind can't help but focus on what's missing: [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] has said nothing of your power, the exercise of your magical gift has not been condoned, condemned, or remarked upon in any way.

      <DefaultText>You've made no secret of your loyalty to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], and you smile at the realization that, if the Overlord is indeed prescient, this victory was enabled by the will of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url].

The question now lingers in your mind - have you been placed in this position because [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] expects you to be loyal, or because [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] expects you to be contrary? And are those mutually exclusive?

It can be no accident that the resolution of the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Execution ordered someone to liberate the base of the Spire. And it can be no coincidence that the culling of the Archons and civil war have brought about much of the carnage [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] initially sought to inflict with that fateful [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url].</DefaultText>
