      <DefaultText>"Bow to you?" She rolls her eyes and turns her head away with a long sigh before continuing.

"The Chorus folk try that line too - offering protection in exchange for our free will. We've thrown so many lives away trying not to bow to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' goons... why would we want to side with you?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Vanish." Elia offers a half-hearted shrug and gestures to the landscape in every direction. "Even if the storms were to stop this moment... what's really left to salvage of this place?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But it's not about what I want, it's about what's going to make sense for everyone else." Chewing her lip, she takes a look out across the windy landscape.

"I've heard dozens say they're debating surrender to the Chorus... considering our circumstances, I think you may be the lesser of several evils."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It would certainly be a much easier task to get the others to join you if you were to help us dispose of the Regents and end the Overlord's storm."

"But to do that, we need to breach Sentinel Stand. And to do THAT, we'll need one of the old relics of the Regent to push through the winds surrounding the fortress."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"According to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url], the storms will only abate when the last of the royal bloodline falls. We hear tell that the last Regent is buttoned-up all safe and secure inside the walls of Sentinel Stand. "

"Unless the final scion of their line charitably kills himself, the storms aren't going anywhere. We need a better defense against the winds, and that means artifacts." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The strength of Stalwart was reinforced by old magic - storied artifacts that could turn soldiers into living walls, or cut through an enemy line with unstoppable force."

"We can't end an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] with an artifact, but we may be able to resist [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' storms with them."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Specifically, we've been hunting for the Steadfast Insignia. I can work with you on recovering it, but we won't get far unless we deal with these [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] first."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"In the long run, we seek vengeance against the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] for tearing Stalwart to bits and the last Regent for [url=lore:edict_storms_resolution]betraying us[/url] when we needed his courage." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"For now, I'll be pleased if we can hold this fort against the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]."

"The fight will come to us whether we're prepared for it or not. My scouts have reported [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] forces closing in, so it would be in your best interest to arm yourselves for battle."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We could use all the extra hands on deck we can muster. Some of our group are being held captive by the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] outside of camp. Deal with the guards and rescue our soldiers - that should give us a few more warm bodies to hurl at the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]."</DefaultText>
