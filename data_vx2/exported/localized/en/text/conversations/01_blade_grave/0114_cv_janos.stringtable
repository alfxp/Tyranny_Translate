      <DefaultText>"Asking someone from Stalwart to accept defeat is a useless endeavor. Listen, fool, I was once like you and stood ready to throw away my life for the 'dignity' of being unbowed by the Overlord."

Eb tears a few loose threads from her blouse and lets the threads go - the tuft of fabric is lost to the winds in the blink of an eye. "By all means, enjoy your civic pride - it goes well with the weather around these parts."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Are all the Overlord's agents so eager to slay each other?" Janos waves his hand with a shake of his head. "No, don't answer that. If you want to knock around some skulls with us, I'm not quite proud enough to turn down the help."

"But if you're expecting me to accept the Overlord in exchange for a few more warm bodies to help our cause, the answer is no."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His friendly expression sours. "The Regents carried the bloodline of old Stalwart's ruling family. That link - any connection to the past, really - carries a lot of weight." He sniffs. "Maybe even too much."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Of all the [url=glossary:younger realms]Younger Realms[/url], Stalwart's ruling order has always been the most resistant to internal conflict. The flippant answer is to say they're all unthinking zealots, but put yourself in their footsteps. For all they've known, the Regents have staved off all foreign invasions for centuries while every other realm in the Tiers cannot boast the same. That's a damn respectable reputation, so it's hard to fault the common folk for being so devoted to their dynasties."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Depends on whom exactly you mean by '[url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url].' Is our last Regent, cowering in Sentinel Stand the defining will of the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url], or are you asking what the rest of the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] want?"

"If you're asking for the Regent's vision of our future - [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] only knows. Maybe the assumption is that [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] will... forget? forgive?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The rest of us, those of who've bled for this realm, we want these storms to end, we want a return to life's less glorious struggles - farming, fishing... those basic things that require a few sunny days now and then."

"Considering that our only way out of the storms is to make sure the Regents are all dead... well... maybe I'm not the patriot I once was, and would sooner see our 'nobles' perish and our lands prosper."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Aye, 'Stalwart's finest' are still guarding their beloved Regent. Which is to say, the retainers of the Regent houses are protecting their own - I get it, family is family, but... if the death of my brother, son, sister, whatever would save thousands of my countrymen..." Janos looks away with a shake of his head.

"I don't know... if slaughtering my own kin would save everyone else, I'd make that sacrifice. But I guess it's too much to ask that of our rulers."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'll put it this way - the folks holed up in Sentinel Stand are all loyal to the Regent - I think any guards courageous enough to do what must be done already tried and failed to rid us of our problem. Those of us outside of Sentinel Stand, those of us truly feeling the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]'s sorrow - we would die for the opportunity to eradicate their spoiled bloodline from Terratus."</DefaultText>
