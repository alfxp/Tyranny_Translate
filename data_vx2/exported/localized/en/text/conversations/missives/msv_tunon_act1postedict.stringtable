Word has reached this court that you have issued the Overlord's [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] to the Archons of War and Secrets. Know that we understand fully the weight of this burden and appreciate the loyalty you show in its declaration. Provided you survive this span, your service will be duly recognized.

As you navigate the idiosyncrasies and mutual antipathy of our Overlord's warmasters, remember that [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] watches all with interest. Those who distinguish themselves, whether Fatebinder or Archon, have the opportunity to rise in the Overlord's esteem. Even now the northern courts whisper that the more successful of the two Archons will be granted rule over the whole of the peninsula. Similarly, your fortunes rest upon the decisions you make.

Choose wisely.

Allow me to express my deep appreciation for this opportunity. Few in the empire have the honor of treating with Archons, and fewer still of reading the empowered words of the Overlord. I endeavor always to emulate your exemplary foresight and judgment.

I remain in all things your faithful servant.

Am I to understand that the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Execution applies equally to all within the valley of [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url], Tiersman and servant of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] alike? Is the Overlord truly willing to sacrifice both the Archon of War and the Archon of secrets, their armies, the farmers and herdsman of the region, and a Fatebinder of no small skill for the sake of killing a handful of insurgents occupying a crumbling ruin?

Is it not said that the Overlord has no desire to rule over a wasteland?

Allow me to express my deep appreciation for being sent into this arid backwater for the sole purpose of applying the lash to a pair of bickering children, a lash that I am only too pleased to find turned upon myself. Your words of advice find a receptive reader in your most devoted servant, gracious as always for your infinite insight and profound respect for your vassals. 

In the likely case of my demise, please know that I go to the void without a hint of bitterness at this treatment.

Perhaps your continued and faithful service shall remind the Archons of their duties to the Overlord. One can hope.

May fortune favor your endeavor.

The wrath of the Overlord falls heavily upon those who have earned it, and we are but instruments of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' terrible will. Disobedience, incompetence, and betrayal require the harshest possible response, lest the world falter and descend again into anarchy. Forget not who you serve, and know that all you do, you do in the name of order and tranquility.

That name is [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url].

I choose to acknowledge the words of your missive and disregard the spirit.

This time.

Consider your tone more carefully in the future. [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] takes particular interest in those agents of the court who presume to write above their station.
