Word reached the court that you have dealt with the seditious mercenaries claiming for themselves the mantle of "defenders" of [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]. You have the gratitude of both myself and the Overlord. The disruptions in the settlement long stymied the production of iron goods for the war effort.

Forge Master Zdenya personally thanked me for your intervention. She further informed me of your arrangement with her. So long as you remain loyal to the Overlord's law, I see no conflict of interests in one of my vassals taking a role of leadership over one of my sworn guilds. 

Take care not to abuse that role.

      <DefaultText>Fatebinder,

Why have my [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] arrived at court seeking asylum given that I have provided them a secure forge at [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url]?

      <DefaultText>Fatebinder,

Word has reached me of the death of my [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] Master, Zdenya. This loss of expertise and mystical skill serves a significant blow to our work in the Tiers. Know that this court intends to fully investigate this unfortunate event and bring capital charges against any found responsible.

I've reclaimed [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] for the people of the Tiers. Zdenya could not accept that. I'm sure you'll want me to answer for my actions in court. I will be ready to do so when the time comes.

I would have preferred that the Master of the Forge and her guild had remained in [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] as you desired, but she was unwilling to work with the [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url], who have both a legitimate legal claim to living in the town and have pledged themselves to our service. 

If you override her wishes and return her to [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url], we will happily continue to defend her.

[url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url] is far from the court and in constant danger from attacks by insurgents and Bane alike. By returning the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] to your care in the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url], I hoped to protect them from the multitudinous dangers of the Tiers. Are they not safer at a distance from the front of this war between Archons?

See that you are. No one stands above the law.

Thank you for your offer. I have found, however, that artisans produce work of markedly lower quality when under duress. Better that you had kept the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] in [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url], but we cannot undo the past.

Learn from your error and take care not to repeat it.

You suggest that you sent Forge Master Zdenya to me. She claims that she fled Haven of her own accord. Fortunately, I am no stranger to contradictory claims. I assure you, the truth will out.

Stand ready to answer for it when it does.
