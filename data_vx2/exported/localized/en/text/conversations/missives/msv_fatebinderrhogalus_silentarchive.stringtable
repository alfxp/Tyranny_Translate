      <DefaultText>Fatebinder [Player Name],

Forgive me the curtness of this rushed missive - the matter is too urgent for the luxury of formalities. 

I know that you braved the flaming ruins of the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url]. 

The Archive - Did you find it? Is it safe?

I thought there no better bearer of the Archive than the Overlord's appointed Archon of Secrets. [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]The Voices of Nerat[/url] now possesses the lore of the Sages.

I trust you agree that this was the wise and legal course of action.

I consigned the knowledge hidden in the Silent Archive to the flame, as per the Overlord's restrictions on Forbidden Knowledge.

Surely you expected nothing less of me.

Naturally I saved the Archive. Why would I destroy the culmination of centuries of [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] learning when it could be turned to better uses? 

It is an impressive artifact. Perhaps one day I will have to show it to you.

Unfortunately I did not find the object of which you speak. Perhaps the Overlord's [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] reduced it to ashes. Or perhaps it never existed at all.

I look forward to speaking when I am again in the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url].

You seem to possess more than a passing familiarity with the Silent Archive. I thought it was something of a secret.

Perhaps an exchange of information is in order: tell me what you know of it, and I can provide you with its current whereabouts.

Better perhaps, then consigning it forever to the flame. I weep at what lore will be lost when the Overlord finally sees fit to extinguish the Voices. Consider that before you next feed it your knowledge. 

It is in the Voices' nature to overreach, for it is never sated. One day, its hunger will turn towards the Overlord, and on that day, [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] will have outlived its usefulness to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url].

      <DefaultText>You fool!

The Archive was a repository like no other! It contained the collected scholarship of centuries! It should have been studied and examined by those well-versed in what lore has been restricted and what must be preserved, not burned in whole like so much dung to fuel the morning fire!

You disappoint me, [Player Name]. You disappoint Terratus, and you disappoint the future.

      <DefaultText>Dear Fatebinder [Player Name],

Rarely in my life have I experienced relief to the extent that your missive inspired. No other action you have taken to this point, incredible as many of them have been, has impressed me so thoroughly.

The vagueness of the better uses of which you spoke could concern one with less faith in your judgment.  Once this civil war concludes, you and I shall have to study the Archive thoroughly so as to determine what aspects of it can be saved and which must be purged under the law.

      <DefaultText>Dear Fatebinder [Player Name],

I must confess to deep disappointment. I believed that I had accepted the possibility that the Archive had been lost to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' flames, but obviously some hope for its preservation lingered still in my breast. Perhaps you think this scholar possessed of a naivet√© unbefitting his years, but the Sages were known to be the foremost practitioners of Tharavis' sigil. If they could find any way to protect a prize of such value, they would have.

I suppose Terratus will have to endure this tragedy as it has the many that have come before.

You are always welcome in our company.

You have me under Mark's blade. I possess only scraps regarding the Archive, fragments gleaned from oblique references across a dozen texts. The Sages sought a way to preserve all knowledge they collected, yet have it easily accessible to those they felt worthy of their secrets. 

I have found no reliable references to what solution they eventually settled on, but there certainly exist indications that they implemented something. Several documents intercepted over the years, some as recently as the Conquest of the Tiers, make reference to Sages bearing their discoveries to the [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url] as tributes to be paid to the Silent Archive.

The manner in which they wrote of it, I half expect you to tell me that the Archive is a living person, some [url=glossary:sage]Sage[/url] volunteer kept alive - or else in a state very like life - through the guild's arts of preservation and healing, their mind forcefully filled to its borders with every stroke of ink set to parchment, compelled through sigils of domination to reveal what they know to those bearing secret signs. 

I enter the realm of speculation, I fear, for we have exhausted what little evidence I have. Keep me in suspense no longer, [Player Name]! What became of the Archive?
