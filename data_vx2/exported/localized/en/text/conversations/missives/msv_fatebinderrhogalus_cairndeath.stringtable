      <DefaultText>Dear Fatebinder [Player Name],

You ended an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url], and now you have ended an Archon. I know none in this Court had such expectations for you when the Adjudicator initially brought you among us. So many surprises in so short a span. You fascinate.

While he lived, [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] was a singular being: a titanic man born of the womb of Terratus herself, to hear some tell it. While none still living can provide account to that birth, you bore witness to his demise. Indeed, you precipitated it. 

I ask that you indulge my scholar's curiosity: what passed between you and the Archon of Stone in those final moments? Did the ground tear itself asunder as a widow rends her garments? Did the mountains groan a panegyric to their champion? Were there any final words from [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] - spoken or inscribed? Does the crystal that reportedly protrudes from the cliff faces throughout Azure still glimmer - or has it darkened?

I watch eagerly for your bird.

      <DefaultText>Fatebinder Rhogalus,

How does one depict the death throes of a nation? In the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Stone, [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] consigned [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] to his doom, but in their ritual, the Earthshakers spread that execution across the entire region. The life drained from the soil even as it faded from [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]'s eyes.

One could verily feel the stone trying to leach my own life from me, as if I'd eaten stale bread when I already thirsted for a flagon. 

We marked this place, and it may never recover.

      <DefaultText>Fatebinder Rhogalus,

The Archon [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] died with the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Stone; the Earthshakers merely reclaimed their patron's power. As we carefully aligned crystalline shafts to channel incandescent energies, roiling auroras of magic twisted overhead. The air reverberated with chanting as the soil drank the blood of the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] who threw themselves ineffectually against our barricades.

No longer will the Earthshakers dally in the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url], picking at the corpse of a rogue Archon. Now they bend their arcane might to the unification of the Tiers under a single banner.

In his final shuddering demise, [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] set the keystone for a new order.

      <DefaultText>Fatebinder Rhogalus,

Whatever the Earthshakers hoped to accomplish with the remains of their errant Archon, I put an end to it. Robed magicians and ironclad warriors alike fell before the onslaught, their rituals cut off mid-chant. The power they drew forth from [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] roiled overhead, shuddering through the land as they collected it. The assault proved enough to disrupt the fragile spellwork, however, making of it a gaping wound. The magic flowed from the Archon of Stone as readily as the blood fled his acolytes, fulfilling the purpose of the Overlord's [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]. 

[url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]'s execution was both savage and beautiful. I shall never forget it.

      <DefaultText>Fatebinder Rhogalus,

You ask how an Archon died and I provide but one answer: by my hand.

My ushering [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] to the void stands as merely the most recent testament to my growing glory.

I am making a career of ending the unendable.

See you at court.

      <DefaultText>Dear Fatebinder Rhogalus,

I took no satisfaction in ending [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] save that which one takes in fulfilling their obligations. The Archon of Stone's presence poisoned the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url], his death throes hourly rocking the people of old Azure. Never have I seen so much suffering caused by the choices of a sole individual.

In executing the Archon of Stone, I both rid the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url] of his protracted corrosion and released him from his agony. It had to be done, but there was no pleasure in it.

Until we meet again.

Unless I am mistaken - and I am very rarely mistaken - I detect in your words remorse. Empathy, though an admirable trait, is wasted on the undeserving. One profits from fretting over the fates of the seditious no more than one profits from concern for the pain suffered by the murderer consigned to the headsman's axe. 

[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] has branded greater lands than Azure with the lingering effects of Edicts. We celebrate such destruction no more than we celebrate a verdict of guilt. They are no more and no less than the currency by which we purchase order and peace.

Thank you for your response and your continued service.

Fascinating! One day we should stroll the remnant streets of the warehouse district and discuss the working of the Earthshakers in greater detail. 

Your desire for a "new order" elicits some concern. Do remember that whatever we craft here we erect to the glory of the Overlord.

Fascinating! Such complex rites - requiring numerous trained magicians carefully shaping sigils with slight variations and specific foci - have historically presented difficulties when confronted by the unexpected. I am gladdened that you were able to interrupt the Earthshaker plot. Only [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] knows what madness they had planned for that colossal stone corpse. 

Thank you for your response and your continued service.

I would caution you against hubris, but such warnings often go unheeded by those they would most benefit.

      <DefaultText>Dear Fatebinder [Player Name],

The Overlord's subjects watch the pronouncements of the Fatebinder and often see only pampered courtiers exalted by whim to parse the guilty from the guiltless. They rarely recognize the toll: the drudgery of study, the labor of training, the toil of investigating innocence and culpability.

Our efforts rarely earn praise. Nor should they. The death of an Archon deserves no more celebration than a verdict of guilt. They are no more and no less than the rings by which we purchase order and peace.

It heartens me that you discerned some moral remuneration in your duties. Remember, though, that our service to the Overlord demands uncompromising adherence to justice, not kindness or gallantry.

Thank you for your response and your continued service.
