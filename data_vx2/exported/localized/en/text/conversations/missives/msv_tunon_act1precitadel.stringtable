The Archons inform me that the recapture of the citadel from the Vendrien insurrectionists continues apace. That they wrote me separately of their divergent tactical intentions engenders no small concern, but I trust now in your efforts.

May your good judgment see you through the coming confrontation with glory and success and back to the safety of our court.

As always, your words fortify me against the imminent difficulty and strife. I eagerly anticipate returning to your hall; a reasonable discussion of the Overlord's legal code appeals greatly after the discord of this campaign.

Your bird finds me on the road to conflict and bloodshed, and I cannot but wonder at the wisdom of the decisions and acts that have brought us to this point. I would not question the Overlord's will, yet I find myself divided.

If this [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] comes to pass and I never see your court again, I hope that you remember the agreements that we forged when you swore me into your service.

      <DefaultText>Archon,

I march towards [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url] fully aware of the fate that likely awaits me, the Archons, and the whole of the Overlord's host within this valley. This [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url], that which has passed since you pressed it into my possession, and the behavior of the Archons have forced me to acknowledge realities of the world I'd not recognized before. 

Should I survive these battles, know that the Fatebinder who returns to you is not the one you sent to face execution.
