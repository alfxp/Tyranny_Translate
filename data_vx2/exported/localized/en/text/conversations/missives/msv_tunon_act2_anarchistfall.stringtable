Iron Hearth sends word that [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] rescinds your welcome within his walls. The Archon of War accuses you of treachery and sedition and demands that I hold you accountable with a public trial and execution. I reminded him that I am the sole arbiter of who runs afoul of the Overlord's legal code but assured him that I would investigate his claims thoroughly. 

Your inability to maintain this court's relationships with its allies disappoints me. Be warned that we all inevitably answer for our choices. You are no exception. 

Meanwhile, I understand that [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] has taken particular interest in you. I trust there is no need to illustrate the implications of his attention.

Cacophony sends word that [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] rescinds your invitation to their revels. The Archon of Secrets sent numerous compliments regarding your treachery and impetuousness, compliments I feel inclined to investigate thoroughly. 

Your inability to maintain this court's relationships with its allies - even those as base and abhorrent as the Chorus - disappoints me. Be warned that we all inevitably answer for our choices. You are no exception.

Meanwhile, I understand that [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] has taken particular interest in you. I trust there is no need to illustrate the implications of his attention.

Calio informs me that your fledgling alliance of Tiersmen has collapsed upon itself. You knew well their fractiousness, yet you persisted in your attempts to coalesce them into a personal army. I hope that this failure neither terribly surprises nor disappoints you.

Your inability to wisely choose your allies disheartens me.

I understand that [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] has taken particular interest in you. I trust there is no need to illustrate the implications of his attention.

I have received word that your former allies have rescinded your welcome among their camps. Accusations of treachery and sedition hound you. I receive daily demands that I hold you accountable with a public trial and execution. I have assured all that I would investigate these claims thoroughly. 

Be warned that we all inevitably answer for our choices. You are no exception.

In the meantime, I understand that [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] has taken particular interest in you. I trust there is no need to illustrate the implications of his attention.

      <DefaultText>Archon [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url],

My service remains to the Overlord, to yourself and your court, and to the laws of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]. That I could not continue abetting the Archon speaks less to my loyalty to the Overlord than it does his criminal behavior. 

I will continue my investigations from the shadows, and I assure you that all treachery will eventually be dragged into the light.

      <DefaultText>Archon [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url],

Why did you pluck me from my prior circumstances and appoint me a Fatebinder if not for my judgment? If I could have both maintained an objective investigation and remained allies with the Archon, I would have. Unfortunately it could not be.

I assure you, Adjudicator, the inquiry continues apace. With [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url]'s guidance, no shadow shall remain unsearched.

      <DefaultText>Archon [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url],

This is merely the latest symptom of our warmasters' incompetence, completing a series that began with the stalling of the Conquest, continued into the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Execution, and culminated with this ridiculous civil war. At minimum, the Archon is criminally incompetent. I suspect, however, more seditious motivations.

I could not continue to work against the interests of the Court. I will aid Archon [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] and remain in your humble service.

      <DefaultText>Archon [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url],

I believed that neither the Archon of Secrets nor the Archon of War could be trusted to complete the Conquest. An alliance of the forces of the Tiers seemed the best path to uniting the peninsula under the Overlord's banner. I confess that I was mistaken. My loyalty to the Overlord remains unshaken, however.

I will work with [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] to continue my investigations into the machinations of the Archons. I hope that I again earn your esteem.

      <DefaultText>Archon [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url],

Why did you pluck me from my prior circumstances and appoint me a Fatebinder if not for my judgment? I believed that working with the Tiersmen would allow me to remain unbiased in fulfilling my obligations. Clearly I underestimated their self-indulgent, backbiting nature. 

I assure you, Adjudicator, the inquiry continues apace. With [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url]'s guidance, no shadow shall remain unsearched.

      <DefaultText>Archon [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url],

The Tiersmen, it turns out, are as prone to infighting and foolishness as the Archons of War and Secrets. Perhaps it was a mistake to trust them to follow orders and unite for their own survival. I would have thought that they would have learned from the mistakes that cost them the Tiers. 

I continue to work the court's interest, albeit with fewer resources at my disposal. I believe that [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url] has a plan to help remedy that.

      <DefaultText>Fatebinder,

You walk the blade's edge and every eye watches. The Tiers verge on anarchy. 

Tread with care.
