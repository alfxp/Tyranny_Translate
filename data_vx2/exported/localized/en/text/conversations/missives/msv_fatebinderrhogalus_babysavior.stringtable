      <DefaultText>Dear Fatebinder [Player Name],

Your actions at Sentinel Stand have once again supplied the rumormongers of the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url] with stories to peddle.  Some seem to think that your cunning twist of legalese intended to display some great support for the people of Stalwart. That, of course, only leads to speculation about which people of Stalwart you intended to benefit: the unbridled upstarts or the corrupt old queens. Others foolishly believe you unraveled the Overlord's [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] to prove that you could, as if a sliver of cleverness could bring [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] low.

As a scholar, I prefer primary sources to gossip, so allow me to ask you plainly: why did you choose to spare the child?

      <DefaultText>Dear Fatebinder Rhogalus,

When faced with the choice to save a child or consign it to death, I chose to save it. That does not seem so strange a thing to me. Either decision would have fulfilled the Overlord's will: the last ruling house of Stalwart met its end in the [url=glossary:blade grave]Blade Grave[/url].

You need read nothing more into it than that.

      <DefaultText>Dear Fatebinder Rhogalus,

The blood of [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url], Archon of War, flows through that child's veins. It should take no scholar of history or governance to recognize the potential in protecting it. The Archon appreciates family above all else. Why would I deprive him of a grandchild born of the ruling family of Stalwart if I could do so without shirking my duty to the Overlord?

I do not make a habit of discarding gifts of fortune.

      <DefaultText>Dear Fatebinder Rhogalus,

You will have to look to the rumormongers for your answers. I keep counsel on this matter only with myself.

      <DefaultText>Dear Fatebinder [Player Name],

You display curious empathy for those who name you enemy. I sincerely hope that history remembers it as one of your critical strengths rather than your most dire weakness.

Remember always that the Overlord favors efficacy over empathy. Rare is the Fatebinder who delivers both.

      <DefaultText>Dear Fatebinder [Player Name],

I suspected that your cleverness did not end at the use of local customs of abdication. You make no mistake in your estimate of the child's probable import to the Archon of War. Its continued existence illuminates a gap in his armor - regardless of whether he cherishes the child or resents it.

I would warn you to play such games carefully, but you seem to have your eye on the board.

      <DefaultText>Dear Fatebinder [Player Name],

You disappoint me. I will interpret this as an unwillingness to set your thoughts to parchment, prone to interception as such missives are, rather than an attempt to avoid indicting yourself to an agent of the court.

Remember: nothing remains unrevealed forever.
