      <DefaultText>Fatebinder,

Allow me to be the first to congratulate you on resolving the situation at the [url=glossary:burning library]Burning Library[/url]. You should see Fatebinder Rhogalus vie against himself: half of him reels at the sheer loss of tomes historical and magical, yet he cannot contain his glee at hearing that the Sages have been finally and entirely broken. 

I do not share his loathing of the old School. They built their own pyre on their hubris, true, but my opposition to them remains purely professional. To have the old [url=glossary:vellum citadel]Vellum Citadel[/url] truly destroyed - my eyes burn at the secrets that met the flame. Comfort comes when I remember that an ambitious Fatebinder would have preserved a few choice pieces of lore, perhaps as much as they could carry out.

I hope you soon make an effort to join us at Court in the [url=glossary:bastard city]Bastard City[/url]. I often feel that it has been too long since we last whispered of the darker corners of Terratus. You've experienced so many of them as of late. Perhaps I can provide illumination.

      <DefaultText>Fatebinder,

Allow me to be the first to congratulate you on resolving the situation at the [url=glossary:burning library]Burning Library[/url]. Fatebinder Rhogalus could not be more pleased by your choice to preserve the texts and relics of the old Sages. Or perhaps he's overjoyed that their grip on the library is now entirely broken. In either case, he almost borders on giddy. Almost.

I do not share his loathing of the old Guild. They built their own pyre on their hubris, true, but my opposition to them remains purely professional. It gladdens me that not their every myriad secret met the flame. I even suspect that an ambitious Fatebinder would have collected a few stray scraps of lore, perhaps as much as they could carry out.

      <DefaultText>Fatebinder,

I suspect I need never again impress upon you the gravity of our role in the Overlord's great work. One can condemn a man who murders for a few rings with a clean conscience. More difficult by far is recognition of the need to end the life of a mother and child. I do not envy you your assignment.

I imagine that, whatever demeanor he adopts, the Archon of War will remember your choice until one of you finds your way to the void.

      <DefaultText>Fatebinder,

You have proven your cleverness in the face of an apparently impossible choice. Would I have been so wise in the same situation? I cannot say. I know only that I do not envy your mission.

I must urge caution, however: some who watch your actions may be more alarmed than amused. Will they be able to convince themselves that the Overlord crafted the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Storms with this loophole in mind? Or will they see in your choice an alternative that cannot be set to parchment?

      <DefaultText>Fatebinder,

Or should I address you as "Governor?"

One wonders how often in history a garrison has been empowered to protect an area only to be broken and scattered by the very individual who granted their authority. You take as freely as you give, it seems. 

It certainly lends you a particular mystique. I have no doubt it will become a cornerstone of the stories told of you. I try to avoid attracting too many stories myself, but far be it for me to tell you how to pursue your objectives.

      <DefaultText>Fatebinder,

So many intersting stories have begun to circle around you: they say you have locked blades with madmen, overcome howling swarms of Magebane, and even, despite the strictures of the Overlord, claimed artifacts from the shadowed depths of the Oldwalls.

You seem to woo attention with the ardency of a newlywed. I try to avoid attracting too many stories myself, but far be it for me to tell you how to pursue your objectives.

      <DefaultText>Fatebinder,

Straydus Herodin's blood stains the flagstones of Sentinel Stand and Chorus crimson drapes from its crenels, yet the Overlord's [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Storms rages still, as if to spite the Archon of War and frustrate his claims on the peninsula.

Weigh your actions with care. In the pursuit of his ambitions, [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] may seem to twist the Overlord's will with impunity, but [url=glossary:bleden mark]Bleden Mark[/url]'s reckoning often comes when one expects it least.

This missive turned out much more dire than I intended!
