      <DefaultText>"I have a hard enough time believing that mighty [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] is dead, much less that you were responsible, traitor. No doubt you are ignorant of what chaos you have wrought on this once-orderly campaign."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I hear no word from Cacophony, save that [url=glossary:the voices of nerat]the Voices of Nerat[/url] acts in a queer manner and that you are a soldier short. I don't know what you did, but I won't pretend it was in the name of anything other than self-interest."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"They say the Adjudicator has fallen. Brother [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] and I were not what you'd call fast friends, but I respected his adherence to order. Someone will have to fill the considerable void left in his wake."</DefaultText>
