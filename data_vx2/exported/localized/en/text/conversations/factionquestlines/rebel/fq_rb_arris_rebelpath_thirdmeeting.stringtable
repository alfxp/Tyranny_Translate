      <DefaultText>"The [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url] are still an option on the table. If we leave the scholars to burn, we stand a chance of claiming the strongest tribe left in the Tiers."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We should welcome the Earthshakers into our fold. Ever since [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]'s downfall, I've heard the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] view their magical allies with disdain and suspicion. Have them renew their vows of fealty to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] before you - I bet they'd welcome the chance to re-establish their good name given their guilt-by-association with [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well we have to contend with the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] and the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url], and I'd argue we need the magic of the Sages - whatever's left of them. I can't imagine they'd turn us down considering their dire circumstances."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Agreed, and in time, we will hopefully cast a wide a net as possible in building this army. But there's no telling if circumstances will get worse in the [url=glossary:stone sea]Stone Sea[/url], nor how much longer the Sages will cling to existence - we need to act swiftly and you can only be in one place at a time."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Raw strength! Savage brutality! Tenacity second only to the Brotherhood! The [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url] aren't just any old tribe of hairy oafs, that tribe has thrived in a realm plagued by[url=lore:edict_stone]the Edict of Stone.[/url] We need that sort of fortitude on our side!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Beastwoman shrugs her meaty shoulders. "Always humans are fearing nature. Tumult in Stone-lands has made [url=glossary:stonestalker]Stonestalker[/url] tribe stronger than ever before. What's good for tribes, is good for Alpha." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"While in ages past, arming one's Beastmen is often a sign of desperation... these are desperate times. I think the [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url] may be a hard ally to win over, but they're the strongest tribe in the land right now - better to have them as friends."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Though the Earthshakers aren't a very large group, their spells to shape, move, and destroy stone would be an extraordinary boon to your coalition... and an important advantage to deny the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I feel it unwise to surround ourselves with mystics - especially ones drawn from our enemies. We need more warm bodies to defend our holdings. That said... we would indeed be stealing from our enemy to strengthen ourselves and... well I can't argue against sound strategy like that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"With [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]'s demise, Radix is their new leader, but Isadora, his close associate, is like the old Archon of Stone - stubborn and independent. And her mindset is hardly uncommon amongst her peers. I know for a fact lots of the earth mages consider [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] their master, [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] is merely the 'Great General' they happen to be following. Such matters are complicated by the fact that, in light of [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]'s fall, [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url] is now the Earthshaker's de facto leader - an arrangement that seems to please no one."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We'd need to give them a compelling reason to risk Ashe's wrath, but it's important to note that the Earthshakers are magical allies to the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] and nothing more. Save for a few exceptions, they do not share the family ties that bind the legion."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Sages know all sorts of magics - protection spells, ways to heal with the gesture of a hand. A few of them were instrumental to the defense of [url=glossary:vendrien's well]Vendrien's Well[/url] - they gave their lives trying to keep the walls held together with magic."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What Eb is trying to say, is that the Sages have a wealth of arcane knowledge - and yes, much of it may have been pilfered over the years but who cares how they know their magic, so long as they're willing to use it for our cause."</DefaultText>
