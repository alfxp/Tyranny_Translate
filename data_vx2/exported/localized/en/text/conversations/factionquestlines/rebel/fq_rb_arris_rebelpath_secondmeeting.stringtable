      <DefaultText>"How you used to run your crew is not my concern. You'll drill with us, share watch duties with us, even forage for roots and kindling if that's what we need.

      <DefaultText>Her eyes light up at the notion of payment, melting a scowl into a reluctant smile. "Appealing to my mercenary code of honor will get you far."

      <DefaultText>"True. I certainly never imagined I'd willingly become an indirect vassal of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] but," the Captain smiles, chuckling to herself, "the threat of death and a merciful Fatebinder can change hearts and minds. Don't quote me on that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Captain Tarkis lets out a long sigh, pausing to think. "We can't be the only ones to come to the conclusion that this war CAN'T be won by force of arms. It's a question of acceptance versus death. I hope others will see that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You proclaimed the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Storms in Stalwart, correct? Don't expect a warm reception from the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] but... think of it this way, we needed help surviving the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Execution and it ended up in us working together. If by any chance you know of or have some way of undoing that other [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] you proclaimed, such an act would earn a lot of goodwill."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Of course, they don't call it Stalwart anymore, they call it the [url=glossary:blade grave]Blade Grave[/url] ever since the [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] of Storms.
