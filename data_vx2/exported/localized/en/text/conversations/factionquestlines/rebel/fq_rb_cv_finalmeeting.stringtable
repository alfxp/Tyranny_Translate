      <DefaultText>"Fatebinder... Archon. We know of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' army marching South, but we had hoped... we were under the impression that we had fulfilled the Overlord's demands. Our attempts to bring peace and unity... what did we do wrong?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] ordered the Archons to bow to one another or fight. The Overlord's forces are no doubt being sent to ensure we don't remain indecisive."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"This is some sort of test. We are claiming stewardship of these lands - [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] is seeing how we defend ourselves."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You did nothing wrong. I'd wager the Overlord is afraid of my power... this is about me, more specifically, [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' raging fear of me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Shit. Am I in over my head? I'm in over my head." Welby massages her brow and glances among the assembled leaders. "I'm beginning to think this whole coalition thing was a bad idea."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Did we not do enough to bring unity to the Tiers? Perhaps the Overlord sees the civil war between the Archons as a spreading illness - perhaps [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] thinks it best to burn us all?" The Forgemaster cups her head in shock. "What more must we do?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I was at your side when you did what was needed at Sentinel Stand, and I'll remain at your side now. If [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] has indeed abandoned us, the [url=glossary:unbroken]Unbroken[/url] will stand with you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Then this peace and unity is a farce! Sure, we may have supplicated ourselves before [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], but no doubt we have been deemed too dangerous to be left alive."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm starting to think I know why [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] raged as he did... perhaps this is what he learned... that loyalty to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] leads to what... ruin, disappointment?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>The Earthshaker bows his head and trembles. "I don't understand... if our loyalty is not enough... then what is? How did we fail? Are we being blamed for the civil war - or for not stopping it sooner?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Beastwoman brays loudly, her bloodlust for battle stoking her into a fiery rage. "Soldiers can come! And can die! [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url] will fight for Tiers-lands! Will ravage and slaughter until our no tresspassers remain!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Now is not the time for us to crumble into despair! Listen to me, the Archon is going to... the Archon..." 

Arri tries to make her voice heard above the rabble, but she lets it drown her out - looking as dejected and hopeless as any of the others.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Be calm. I can repel [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' army or whatever else comes our way."</DefaultText>

      <ID>76</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Perhaps I need to send word to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] and let the Overlord know we have completed the unification of the Tiers."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If this is our reward for loyalty, I'm inclined to say we declare war on [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <ID>80</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Have you taken a head wound recently? We don't have the forces to stand against this threat! How can you possibly outmaneuver the Northern Empire as it breathes down our neck?" </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The coalition representatives bicker among themselves, and Arri struggles to find a voice in the growing unrest. Something about your empty stare causes them to gradually fall in line, one by one, and await your word.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Something tells me the Overlord might not be listening... or caring. But if this is just a misunderstanding, then yes - tell [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] the Tiers are under control! Call off the reinfrocements!"</DefaultText>

      <ID>83</ID>
      <DefaultText>"So THIS is what it takes for you to throw off your chains?" Arri blushes, covering her face between slow, pained chuckling. "If this is how [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] treats friends, we may as well be the enemy."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I can use the Resonator atop the Mountain Spire to cast an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url] into the Northern Empire."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>85</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The Resonator atop the Mountain Spire might carry my words to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]. Perhaps the Overlord is awaiting my official surrender."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>86</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The Resonator atop the Mountain Spire is our only hope. From there, I could declare my surrender to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]... or declare an [url=glossary:edict]Edict[/url]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The room grows hushed again as everyone studies you, your words finding a place in their imagination that had not existed a second before.

Arri speaks up with care. "That would certainly... get the Overlord's attention." </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>90</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Perhaps [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] assumes I am some mere Archon - I need to make my power and intentions clear."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>91</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I have been loyal to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], and dealt with the other Archons as requested. Now I need only tell [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] that my mission is complete."</DefaultText>

      <ID>93</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Such a display of power may force the incoming troops to reconsider... or it may solidify [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' desire to see us all burn."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>94</ID>
      <DefaultText>"By all means, tell the Overlord the fight is over - the Tiers belong to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] - that is no longer in question. The question now is, did our loyalty even matter?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>95</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And what if that works? What if surrender calls off the armies?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>96</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But if that works, and [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' forces retreat... what comes next? What becomes of the Tiers?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>100</ID>
      <DefaultText>"[url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] only knows what's next. Maybe the Overlord will fear my power and declare war... but hopefully [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] is wiser than that."</DefaultText>
