      <DefaultText>"This power makes you... unlike any other Archon. I wonder, will [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] value your talent, or seek to destroy it? We should be ready for either possibility."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I wonder if [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] ever suspected that the Overlord's power could be attained? Could he have been on the same journey you walk now? If so... may his passing be a warning."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I wonder if [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url] had discovered a way to attain the Overlord's level of power... could that be why [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] wished him dead?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"If you did this in a moment of crisis, think of what you could accomplish if you put your will behind it. The thought almost makes me respect [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' sense of restraint."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She bares her blade-sharp fangs, eager. "Strongest of [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url] fights with strongest of humans. Is nature's own desire."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"When I'm old and gray, you can mock me for how foolish I was to think the Tiers would unite against [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]. The sad truth is, we have always been our own worst enemy - it took [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] to unite us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I suppose if we are to be loyal minions of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], we ought to start acting the part - down to the wanton violence. I for one have countless brethren to avenge, and no doubt Ashe's Aegis makes torturing the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] a merry affair."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A glimmer of hope appears on her face. "Because we have been carried this far... now we have to prove ourselves capable of doing what must be done. With the grace of [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], we will end this long struggle, and the Tiers will know peace."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Let us show the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] and the [url=glossary:scarlet chorus]Scarlet Chorus[/url] a shallow grave! Let us put down the rabid Archons and bring peace to the Tiers. Let us show the Overlord that the Tiersmen stand tall!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Do you two hear yourselves? What of unity? If you wish to offend the Overlord with talk of division, why haven't you joined with the Chorus?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We can't start turning on each other now! If we do, we are no better than the Chorus. Come now, we have all decided to seek unity and peace - if we abandon that, we give the Overlord every reason to abandon us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I hate to be the dissenter here, but that's exactly right. The Fatebinder has proven himself greater than any of us combined, and we should do everything in our power to nurture his potential - even if a few lives are lost in the process." </DefaultText>
