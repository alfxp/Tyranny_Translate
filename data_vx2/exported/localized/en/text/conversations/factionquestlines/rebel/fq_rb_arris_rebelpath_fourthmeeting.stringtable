      <DefaultText>"Humans are right to fear Beastwomen. Is natural for prey to tremble in presence of predator. Of own hunter." She snaps her jaws viciously to sharpen her point, and it sounds almost like boulders breaking. "But as Beastwoman has said - [url=glossary:stonestalker]Stonestalker[/url] will help humans, and tribe will grow strong together."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Enough of that! You don't want the Fatebinder hearing such things, do you? We must treat [url=glossary:ascension hall]Ascension Hall[/url] as an extension of the Court."

      <DefaultText>"I was simply saying how surprised I am to see so many once-proud southerners bow to [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url]'s Court. Not a complaint, mind you - the Tiersmen deserve [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' mercy as much as anyone. We are all fortunate they have surrendered their pride and bowed to the Overlord - it would be a shame to have to kill any more of them."</DefaultText>

"As our Guild enters its next chapter, we will do so loyal subjects to your cause. May [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url] have mercy on any of my Guildmates who still flock to [url=glossary:graven ashe]Graven Ashe[/url]'s banner. From here forward, they are anathema to us."</DefaultText>

The soldier twists on the blade, and the gathering watches in silence as Welby steps in close, catching the man as he collapses dead into her arms. With the deed done, she lays him out on the ground, then dusts her hands off with a smile.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With a sickening crack, the soldier falls to his knees, his face pale as the life races out of him. His form crumples to the ground to reveal Zdenya standing behind him, hammer in hand.
