      <DefaultText>"Sirin? The Songbird? Feels like it's half the town she's got mooning over her in that hovel near the river. It's on the first tier, if you want to find her." His brow knits.

      <DefaultText>Eldian sighs, and nods slowly. "As you will it, Fatebinder. After everything you have done for [url=glossary:lethian's crossing]Lethian's Crossing[/url], I will trust your judgment. 'The hero's path is hard fought and even harder walked.' my mother always said. I can't say I ever knew what she meant until now. If you say the helmet is better left in your hands, I believe you."</DefaultText>
