      <DefaultText>"By order of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] the Adjudicator, I am here to bring order to the Tiers. Reaffirm your loyalty to the Court, and to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url], by bowing to me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Is this some sort of test? The [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] are, were, and always will be loyal to [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url], Archon of Justice. If we must renew our vows of fealty, the Court has every right to make that demand, but such formalities will need to wait until I'm done with my original task - protecting this settlement."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I have to place this relic by the Oldwalls to help seal off any threats. A site has been readied on the third tier - I'm headed there now, we can talk more when it's through."

"Better yet, join me. Once the Magebane is in place, the seal on the Oldwalls should be set, and I can give you my complete attention."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Is there some concern the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] will take sides in this dispute? It's true, we've failed to make a perfectly equal number of blades for the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] as we have for the Chorus... but we aren't behind this war, nor trying to stoke the flames of its conflict. We are, and will remain, servants of [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url] - that shouldn't be in question."</DefaultText>

With a wince of a pain, she dips in a bow of supplication.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Considering the state of affairs between the [url=glossary:disfavored]Disfavored[/url] and the Chorus, it would seem prudent for the guild to cease providing arms and armor to anyone outside of the Court." Zdenya nods with a grim scowl as she counts on her fingers. "There will be a few dozen unfulfilled orders but... our dignity will endure."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There are others helping the Court's efforts? Good, I'll size them up and have them fitted at the earliest possibility."

She turns to leave before halting herself and looking back at you with a wry smile. "I'll be honest, I think your efforts at peace are futile... I think the old general and the lunatic spy master are going to destroy each other first. But if anyone can knock some sense into them, maybe it'll be you. Good luck, Fatebinder."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Absolutely not. The [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] work better without outside interference. The [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url] offer nothing to us. If you will have the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url] serving your army, it will be without the Brotherhood."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Before now, you might have been able to convince me to work together, regardless of my feelings about the [url=glossary:forge-bound]Forge-Bound[/url]. They are arrogant and condescending, but their work is unparalleled. But now? No. I am tired of dealing with them. The [url=glossary:bronze brotherhood]Bronze Brotherhood[/url] are a disciplined, well-trained crew. Our accomplishments speak for themselves. We will not help if it means we have to endure their presence."</DefaultText>

She bows with a pained wince. "I will meet with your retainers and have them sized and fitted at once. Glory to [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url], and glory to [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]!"</DefaultText>
