      <DefaultText>"By the authority vested in me by [url=glossary:tunon]Tunon[/url], Archon of Justice, I am uniting the Tiers under my own banner. I want the [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url] to join with us, so that your strength may endure."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A deep growl rips from her throat and her lips peel back to reveal large, yellowed fangs.

"Why would [url=glossary:stonestalkers]Stonestalkers[/url] help humans when tribe is only just free? Do humans so quickly forget course of own deeds? No. [url=glossary:prima]Prima[/url] will not risk tribe for non-kith, and will not leave Stone-lands, especially now while humans encroach on territory."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Why? Because those of us who want to live know that [url=glossary:kyros]Kyros[/url]' invasion of our lands is inevitable. For the moment you may feel free, but when the Archons finish their lovers' quarrel, the victor will come for your tribe."

"Or you could stand with us, join your strength to ours, and help usher in an end to these years of war."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Humans always try yipping and whining to get own way." She growls and points a claw at Eb. "But [url=glossary:prima]Prima[/url] requires show of strength, not words for convincing!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The massive Beastwoman cocks her head, curious and clearly impressed. Slowly, she leans close, her nose brushing your neck as she sniffs and snuffs, nearly panting against your skin.

"Is true. Human wears scent of Chorus blood. Smells rank but also good."

She leans back and licks the tip of a long claw.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Tribe is free because of Hundred-Blood's prowess and because of toughness of [url=glossary:cairn]Cairn[/url]."

Her feral, amber eyes glance to the ground, and she scuffs her foot against the gritted bedrock as she thinks.

      <DefaultText>She snorts, amused.

"Human demonstrates strength of Alpha and of Beastwoman, but vigor alone is not enough to tempt Hundred-Blood to promise entire tribe to human."</DefaultText>
